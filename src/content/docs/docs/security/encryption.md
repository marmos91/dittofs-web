DittoFS can encrypt every block before it leaves the server using a per-remote, decorator-based encryption layer. Encryption is opt-in per remote block store and composes with the existing compression decorator.

## Threat model

Encryption protects block payloads against:

- Operators of the remote block store (S3 provider, MinIO admins).
- Anyone with read access to the bucket / prefix where blocks are stored.
- Theft of the underlying storage media.

Encryption does **not** protect:

- **Metadata.** Filenames, directory structure, file sizes, and timestamps are stored in the metadata backend in plaintext.
- **In-memory state.** Plaintext blocks live in the cache (RAM and disk tier) while a share is mounted. For full at-rest protection of the cache, place each share's local storage directory on an encrypted filesystem (FileVault / LUKS / dm-crypt).
- **Compromised dfs daemons.** The master key bytes live in process memory for the daemon's lifetime; anyone with `ptrace` against the daemon can recover them.

## Design overview

Standard envelope encryption, matching AWS SSE-KMS, MinIO + KES, and HashiCorp Vault Transit:

1. A **master key** is held by a key provider (local file or KMIP-speaking HSM). The master key never directly encrypts a block.
2. For each block, a fresh 32-byte **block key** is generated from `crypto/rand` and used with an AEAD to encrypt the payload.
3. The block key is **wrapped** under the master key. The wrapped bytes live in the block frame header, alongside the master-key identifier.
4. On read: parse the frame → unwrap the block key via the provider → AEAD-decrypt the payload.

The plaintext BLAKE3 hash binds the ciphertext to its CAS address — a swapped block fails authentication.

### Decorator order

```
PUT  plaintext  →  compression  →  encryption  →  S3
GET  S3         →  decryption    →  decompression → plaintext
```

Compression must run **before** encryption. Encrypted bytes are statistically indistinguishable from random data, which a compressor cannot shrink.

### Wire frame

```
offset 0..4   magic              5 bytes  "DFENC"
offset 5      version            1 byte   0x01
offset 6      aead algorithm     1 byte   1: AES-256-GCM, 2: ChaCha20-Poly1305, 3: XChaCha20-Poly1305
offset 7      wrap kind          1 byte   0x01 (keyprovider managed)
offset 8..    master-key-id      uvarint length + bytes
offset ..     wrapped block key  uvarint length + bytes
offset ..     nonce              1-byte length + bytes (12 for GCM/Poly1305, 24 for XChaCha20)
offset ..     ciphertext + tag   rest of the body
```

## Configuration

Encryption is enabled per remote block store by setting an `encryption` block in the remote's config JSON. Add it via `dfsctl`:

```bash
# Generate a passphrase-protected key file (OpenSSL-style; any 16+ bytes of
# random entropy suffices — DittoFS derives the file-encryption key with
# Argon2id, so high passphrase entropy gives high real entropy).
read -srp 'passphrase: ' DITTOFS_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE; export DITTOFS_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE

# Local-file provider
dfsctl store block remote add \
  --name s3-encrypted --type s3 --bucket prod-data \
  --encryption-aead aes-256-gcm \
  --encryption-key-kind local \
  --encryption-key-file /etc/dittofs/keys/share.key

# KMIP provider
dfsctl store block remote add \
  --name s3-hsm --type s3 --bucket regulated-data \
  --encryption-aead aes-256-gcm \
  --encryption-key-kind kmip \
  --encryption-kmip-endpoint kms.example.com:5696 \
  --encryption-kmip-cert /etc/dittofs/kmip/client.pem \
  --encryption-kmip-key  /etc/dittofs/kmip/client.key \
  --encryption-kmip-ca   /etc/dittofs/kmip/ca.pem \
  --encryption-kmip-key-uid 12345-abcde-...
```

Generate a fresh key file (no dedicated subcommand — call the Go helper directly):

```go
import "github.com/marmos91/dittofs/pkg/blockstore/encryption/keyprovider"

bytes, _ := keyprovider.GenerateKeyFile("your-strong-passphrase")
os.WriteFile("/etc/dittofs/keys/share.key", bytes, 0o600)
```

### Equivalent YAML view of the config blob

```yaml
encryption:
  aead: aes-256-gcm           # aes-256-gcm | chacha20-poly1305 | xchacha20-poly1305
  key:
    kind: local               # local | kmip
    # kind=local
    file: /etc/dittofs/keys/share.key
    # kind=kmip
    endpoint: kms.example.com:5696
    server_ca: /etc/dittofs/kmip/ca.pem
    client_cert: /etc/dittofs/kmip/client.pem
    client_key:  /etc/dittofs/kmip/client.key
    key_uid: 12345-abcde-...
    timeout_ms: 5000
```

### Passphrase handling

The passphrase that unlocks a local key file is read **only** from the `DITTOFS_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` environment variable. The daemon (and `dfsctl` when it loads a provider) will fail to start if the variable is unset.

Argon2id parameters (m = 64 MiB, t = 3, p = 4) match the OWASP 2024 password-storage guidance.

## KMIP provider behaviour

The KMIP provider fetches the configured master key from the HSM at startup using the standard `Get` operation and caches the bytes in process memory for the daemon's lifetime. All wrap / unwrap happens locally with AES-256-GCM.

This is a real KMIP integration (mutual-TLS, KMIP 1.4 protocol via `github.com/gemalto/kmip-go`) but it is **not** HSM-resident envelope encryption — the master-key bytes do live in the daemon's address space while it runs. A future iteration can move wrap / unwrap into the HSM via KMIP `Encrypt` / `Decrypt` operations without changing the `KeyProvider` interface; the public surface stays the same.

To rotate: write a new key to the HSM, update the `key_uid` in the remote config, and restart the share. Existing blocks remain decryptable because every frame carries the master-key identifier that wrapped its block key.

### Validating against a KMIP server

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name pykmip -p 5696:5696 pykmip/pykmip:latest

DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP=1 \
  DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP_ENDPOINT=localhost:5696 \
  DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP_CERT=test/fixtures/kmip/client.pem \
  DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP_KEY=test/fixtures/kmip/client.key \
  DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP_CA=test/fixtures/kmip/ca.pem \
  DITTOFS_TEST_KMIP_KEY_UID=<your-key-uid> \
  go test ./pkg/blockstore/encryption/keyprovider/...
```

## Prior art

The design is intentionally derivative — envelope encryption is the well-trodden path for client-side encryption of object storage:

- **AWS S3 SSE-KMS** — per-object random data key wrapped by a customer master key.
- **MinIO + KES** — Go-stack precedent for the KMIP-backed envelope model.
- **HashiCorp Vault Transit** — wrap / unwrap API with master keys held server-side.
- **age (filippo.io/age)** — informed the AEAD choice (ChaCha20-Poly1305) but its stream-only shape was wrong for per-block random access.

## Operational warnings

Read this section before turning encryption on in production.

### Enable encryption at remote-store creation time only

Adding an `encryption` block to a remote store that already contains plaintext blocks will make every existing block **permanently unreadable** through the share — `Get` will return `ErrCiphertextWithoutFrame` because the stored bytes lack the DFENC frame header. The decorator refuses to interpret unframed bytes on an encryption-enabled share; that is intentional (any other behaviour would let a tampered-S3 actor force a plaintext downgrade).

Recommendation: create new remote stores with encryption enabled, migrate data across, then decommission the unencrypted store.

### Master-key rotation requires a full re-encrypt

There is no key-rotation tooling in this release. Every stored frame records the master-key identifier that wrapped its block key; after rotating to a new master key (writing a new `key_file` or registering a new KMIP key UID), `Unwrap` will return `ErrWrongMasterKey` for every block written under the prior key. The data is **not recoverable** without the prior master key.

If you must rotate today: keep the old master key available, stage a new remote store under the new key, and copy data across before retiring the old store. A future release will ship a bulk re-wrap command and multi-key `Unwrap`.

### AAD is per-block, not per-share

The associated data bound into the AEAD is the 32-byte BLAKE3 plaintext hash. It binds ciphertext to its CAS address but does **not** bind it to a share identity. Two shares that reference the same remote store config — and therefore share the same master key — could decrypt each other's blocks if an attacker with direct object-store write access moved blocks between share namespaces. This is acceptable for the supported configuration (one remote-store config per workload) but is a hazard if you reuse one master key across security-domain-distinct shares. Do not do that.

## What's not in scope (yet)

- **Master-key rotation tooling** — the frame already records `master_key_id`, so a future bulk rewrite job can re-wrap.
- **Filename / size / timestamp encryption** — out of scope; metadata stays unencrypted.
- **Encrypted disk cache tier** — current cache holds plaintext in RAM / disk; use an encrypted filesystem underneath if needed.
- **FIPS 140-3 mode** — would require swapping Argon2id for PBKDF2-SHA256, pinning AES-only AEADs, and building with the BoringCrypto tag.
