## Windows VM Setup Guide

### Option A: UTM (macOS ARM Host) -- Recommended for Apple Silicon

UTM is the recommended VM solution for Apple Silicon Macs running DittoFS.

1. **Download and install UTM** from [mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app/)
2. **Download Windows 11 ARM ISO** from [Microsoft UUP dump](https://uupdump.net/) or the official Microsoft site
3. **Create a new VM:**
   - Click "Create a New Virtual Machine" > "Virtualize"
   - Select "Windows"
   - Allocate at least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores
   - Allocate 64 GB disk (minimum)
   - Enable "Install drivers and SPICE tools"
4. **Attach the Windows 11 ARM ISO** and boot the VM
5. **Complete Windows 11 installation** (skip network during OOBE if needed, use a local account)

### Option B: VirtualBox / Hyper-V (x86 Host)

For x86 hosts or non-macOS environments:

- **VirtualBox:** Download from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/), create a Windows 11 x64 VM with at least 4 GB RAM, enable EFI and TPM 2.0 emulation
- **Hyper-V:** Available on Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise, enable via "Turn Windows features on or off"

### Network Configuration

The Windows VM must be able to reach the DittoFS host machine over the network.

| Network Mode | When to Use | Configuration |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Bridged** | VM and host on same LAN | VM gets its own IP from DHCP; use host's LAN IP to connect |
| **Host-only** | Isolated testing | Configure a host-only network adapter; use host-only gateway IP |
| **Shared (NAT)** | Default in UTM | Forward ports 12445 (SMB) and 12049 (NFS) from host to guest |

**Verify connectivity:** From the Windows VM, open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <host-ip> -Port 12445
```

### Required Windows Features

#### Services for NFS (for NFS client testing)

1. Open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Optional Features** > **More Windows features**
2. Expand **Services for NFS**
3. Check **Client for NFS**
4. Click OK and restart if prompted

#### SMB Client

The SMB client is installed and enabled by default on Windows 11. No additional setup is needed.

### Guest Auth GPO Configuration

**Windows 11 24H2 blocks insecure guest logons by default.** Since DittoFS currently uses guest/anonymous SMB sessions for initial negotiation, you must enable insecure guest logons.

**Option 1: Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)**

1. Press `Win+R`, type `gpedit.msc`, press Enter
2. Navigate to: **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Network** > **Lanman Workstation**
3. Double-click **"Enable insecure guest logons"**
4. Set to **Enabled**, click OK
5. Restart the Lanman Workstation service or reboot

**Option 2: Registry (for Windows 11 Home or scripted setup)**

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" -Name "AllowInsecureGuestAuth" -Value 1 -Type DWord
Restart-Service LanmanWorkstation
```

**Registry path:** `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\AllowInsecureGuestAuth` = 1 (DWORD)

### Optional Software

| Software | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **VS Code** | Test opening projects from SMB share, file editing, integrated terminal |
| **Microsoft Office** | Test Word/Excel save/open cycles with Office file locking |
| **7-Zip or WinRAR** | Test archive extraction to/from share |

### DittoFS Server Setup

On the macOS/Linux host machine:

```bash
# 1. Build DittoFS
go build -o dfs cmd/dfs/main.go
go build -o dfsctl cmd/dfsctl/main.go

# 2. Initialize config (if first time)
./dfs config init

# 3. Start DittoFS
./dfs start

# 4. Create test stores
./dfsctl store metadata add --name test-meta --type memory
./dfsctl store block local add --name test-blocks --type memory

# 5. Create test shares
./dfsctl share create --name /smbbasic --metadata test-meta --local test-blocks

# 6. Create test users
./dfsctl user create --username testuser    # Enter password when prompted

# 7. Grant permissions
./dfsctl share permission grant /smbbasic --user testuser --level read-write

# 8. Verify SMB adapter is listening
./dfsctl adapter list
# Should show SMB adapter on port 12445
```

**Connect from Windows:**

```cmd
# Mapped drive (persistent)
net use Z: \\<host-ip>\smbbasic /user:testuser <password>

# UNC path (direct access)
explorer \\<host-ip>\smbbasic
```

---

## SMB Validation Checklist

Test both **mapped drives** (e.g., `Z:`) and **UNC paths** (e.g., `\\host\smbbasic`) for each category.

## NFS Client Validation Checklist

Windows NFS client support is best-effort. The Windows Services for NFS client has known limitations compared to Linux/macOS NFS clients.

### NFS Connection

| # | Test | Command | Result | Notes |
|---|------|---------|:---:|-------|
| NFS-01 | Mount NFS share | `mount -o anon \\<host-ip>\export Z:` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | Port 12049 |
| NFS-02 | List share contents | `dir Z:\` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |
| NFS-03 | Unmount | `umount Z:` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |

### NFS File Operations

| # | Test | Command | Result | Notes |
|---|------|---------|:---:|-------|
| NFS-04 | Create file | `echo test > Z:\nfstest.txt` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |
| NFS-05 | Read file | `type Z:\nfstest.txt` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |
| NFS-06 | Create directory | `mkdir Z:\nfsdir` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |
| NFS-07 | Delete file | `del Z:\nfstest.txt` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |
| NFS-08 | Delete directory | `rmdir Z:\nfsdir` | [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail / [ ] Skip | |

## Known Limitations

The following features are **not supported**. Most are deliberate scope decisions, not bugs.

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround | Status |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| **No Alternate Data Streams (ADS)** | NTFS named streams (`:Zone.Identifier`, etc.) not available | None -- files from Internet may lack "Unblock" option | Not planned |
| **No multi-channel** | Single TCP connection per session | Performance limited to single connection throughput | Future |
| **NFS from Windows** | Windows NFS client (Services for NFS) has limited functionality | Use SMB for primary Windows file access; NFS is best-effort | -- |
| **No NTFS object IDs** | `FSCTL_CREATE_OR_GET_OBJECT_ID` not supported | No impact for typical workflows | Not planned |
| **No DFS referrals** | Distributed File System namespace not supported | Access shares directly by server IP/hostname | Not planned |

SMB3 encryption and signing, change notifications, durable handles, and
server-side copy (`FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK`) **are** supported — see
[SMB.md](/docs/protocols/smb).

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "The network path was not found" | DittoFS not running or firewall blocking port | Verify `dfs start` is running; check port 12445 is accessible with `Test-NetConnection` |
| "Access denied" | Invalid credentials or missing share permissions | Verify user exists (`dfsctl user list`), check share permissions (`dfsctl share permission list /smbbasic`) |
| "The specified network name is no longer available" | Connection dropped during operation | Retry `net use`; check DittoFS logs for errors |
| "Insecure guest logon" error | Windows 11 24H2 blocks guest logons by default | Follow [Guest Auth GPO Configuration](#guest-auth-gpo-configuration) above |

### Permission Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Explorer shows blank Security tab | SD query failed or returned malformed data | Check DittoFS logs for SD synthesis errors |
| Explorer shows "Everyone: Full Control" | SD synthesis not returning proper owner/DACL | Verify machine SID is initialized (`dfsctl settings list`); ensure share has assigned user |
| `icacls` shows unexpected permissions | POSIX-to-DACL translation differs from NTFS semantics | This is expected behavior; DittoFS synthesizes DACLs from Unix mode bits |
| `Set-Acl` returns error | Best-effort ACL mapping failed | DittoFS translates SMB SET_INFO ACL changes to Unix mode bits; complex ACLs may not map cleanly |

### Performance Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Slow large file copies | Throughput limited to a single TCP connection (no multi-channel) | Ensure sufficient network bandwidth |
| Explorer feels sluggish | Many small SMB round-trips | Reduce auto-refresh extensions |
| Office save takes long | Office uses multiple SMB operations (create temp, write, rename) | Expected behavior; ensure sufficient network bandwidth |

### NFS-Specific Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `mount` command not found | Services for NFS not installed | Install via Settings > Apps > Optional Features > More Windows features > Services for NFS > Client for NFS |
| Mount fails with "Network Error" | Wrong port or protocol | Ensure DittoFS NFS adapter is on port 12049; try `mount -o anon,nolock \\host\export Z:` |
| Permission denied on NFS mount | UID/GID mapping issues | Windows NFS client uses anonymous UID/GID by default; configure in NFS client settings or use `mount -o anon` |

## Conformance Test Results

DittoFS is validated against two industry-standard conformance test suites.

### WPTS (Microsoft WindowsProtocolTestSuites)

- **Suite:** MS-SMB2 BVT (Build Verification Tests)
- **Known failures:** See [test/smb-conformance/KNOWN_FAILURES.md](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/docs/KNOWN_FAILURES.md)
- **Run locally:**
  ```bash
  cd test/smb-conformance
  make test        # Run WPTS BVT suite
  make test-quick  # Quick run (memory profile only)
  ```

### smbtorture (Samba Test Suite)

- **Suite:** Full SMB2 test suite (`smb2.*`)
- **Image:** quay.io/samba.org/samba-toolbox:v0.8
- **Known failures:** See [test/smb-conformance/smbtorture/KNOWN_FAILURES.md](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/docs/KNOWN_FAILURES.md)
- **Run locally:**
  ```bash
  cd test/smb-conformance
  make smbtorture        # Run full smbtorture suite
  make smbtorture-quick  # Quick run (memory profile only)
  ```

### Running Both Suites

```bash
cd test/smb-conformance
make test smbtorture     # Run WPTS + smbtorture in sequence
```

Both test suites run in CI via `.github/workflows/smb-conformance.yml` on every PR touching SMB-related code.
