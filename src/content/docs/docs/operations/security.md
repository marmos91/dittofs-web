## What is implemented

- Kerberos authentication for NFS via RPCSEC_GSS (RFC 2203)
- Kerberos authentication for SMB via SPNEGO
- Active Directory / LDAP idmap (`idmap_ad` RFC2307 attributes or `idmap_rid` RID derivation), with Kerberos keytab and NTLM machine-account pass-through
- SMB3 encryption with AES-128-GCM, AES-128-CCM, AES-256-GCM, AES-256-CCM
- SMB3 signing with AES-128-CMAC and AES-128-GMAC; SMB 2.x signing with HMAC-SHA256
- SMB 3.1.1 preauth integrity (SHA-512 hash chain) for downgrade protection
- SP800-108 key derivation for per-session cryptographic keys
- VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO for SMB 3.0/3.0.2 downgrade detection
- NFSv4 ACL-based access control
- POSIX file permission enforcement (owner/group/other)
- Export-level IP-based access restrictions
- Identity mapping (root squash, all squash)
- AUTH_UNIX for trusted-network deployments
- Native TLS (and optional mutual TLS) for the control plane API with hot-reload
- NFS-over-TLS (RFC 9289): opportunistic `AUTH_TLS` STARTTLS upgrade to TLS 1.3

## Remaining limitations

- No formal security audit performed
- NFS-over-TLS requires a client that supports RFC 9289 (`xprtsec=tls`); macOS has no such client (use Kerberos or a network tunnel instead)
- No encryption at rest
- No audit logging for file operations

---

## Authentication

### NFS: RPCSEC_GSS (Kerberos)

DittoFS implements RPCSEC_GSS per RFC 2203, enabling Kerberos-based strong authentication for
NFSv4 clients. This is the recommended authentication method for any deployment outside of a
fully trusted network.

When enabled, clients authenticate using Kerberos tickets. The server validates tickets against
its keytab and maps Kerberos principals to Unix UID/GID for authorization decisions.

Key properties:

- Mutual authentication (server identity is also verified by the client)
- Cryptographic credential verification (no trust-based UID spoofing)
- Configurable context lifetime and clock skew tolerance
- Hot-reload support for keytab rotation without server restart

See [Kerberos configuration](#kerberos-configuration) for setup instructions.

### NFS: AUTH_UNIX

AUTH_UNIX is the traditional NFS authentication mechanism. The client provides UID, GID, and
supplementary GIDs with each request. The server trusts these values without independent
verification.

- Suitable for trusted networks only
- Clients can impersonate any user by sending arbitrary UID/GID values
- Use identity mapping (root squash, all squash) to limit exposure

### NFS: AUTH_NULL

AUTH_NULL provides anonymous access with no authentication. All requests are treated as coming
from an unauthenticated user. Use with extreme caution and only for public read-only shares.

### SMB: Kerberos via SPNEGO

The SMB adapter supports Kerberos authentication through SPNEGO during `SESSION_SETUP`. When a
Kerberos provider is configured, SMB clients authenticate using Kerberos tickets. When Kerberos
is not configured, the SMB adapter falls back to NTLM or guest authentication.

See [Kerberos configuration](#kerberos-configuration) for shared setup that applies to both NFS
and SMB.

### SMB: NTLM and guest fallback

**Guest sessions** have significant security limitations: no session key is available, so no
signing and no encryption are possible. Guest sessions should be restricted to read-only access
on public shares. DittoFS never encrypts guest sessions, even in `required` mode (the connection
is rejected instead).

**NTLM fallback** occurs when Kerberos keytab is not configured, the client has no valid TGT, or
DNS resolution prevents Kerberos service ticket acquisition.

NTLM authenticates two classes of user:

- **Local DittoFS users:** the NTLMv2 response is validated directly against the NT hash stored
  in the control-plane user store.
- **AD domain users:** when a machine account is configured (`kerberos.machine_account`), the
  challenge/response is forwarded to the Domain Controller over a sealed NETLOGON secure channel
  (MS-NRPC sign+seal AES, post-ZeroLogon). The DC performs the validation; no local NT hash is
  stored or used. **Without a machine account, domain-user NTLM fails with
  `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`.**

> **Machine secret sensitivity:** the machine account shared secret is stored at rest in
> plaintext (like the LDAP bind password and Kerberos keytab). It is write-only and redacted from
> API responses. Protect it with filesystem permissions equivalent to a keytab file (`chmod 600`).

NTLM security tradeoffs:

- No mutual authentication (client cannot verify server identity)
- Vulnerable to relay attacks without channel binding
- Session key derived from password hash (weaker than Kerberos session key)
- Signing uses HMAC-SHA256 (weaker than AES-CMAC/GMAC)
- NETLOGON passthrough requires a pre-provisioned machine account

**Recommendation:** configure Kerberos for all production deployments. Use NTLM only as a
transition mechanism or for clients that cannot use Kerberos.

### Active Directory and LDAP

DittoFS can authenticate Active Directory domain users directly, with no local DittoFS
account for them. Three pieces are independent and can be enabled in any combination:

| Piece | What it does | Credential at rest |
|---|---|---|
| **Kerberos service keytab** | Verifies AD-issued service tickets over SMB (SPNEGO) and NFS (RPCSEC\_GSS) | Keytab file |
| **Machine account** (`kerberos.machine_account`) | Forwards the NTLM challenge/response to the Domain Controller over a sealed NETLOGON channel, for clients that cannot use Kerberos | Computer account secret |
| **LDAP idmap** | Maps the authenticated principal or SID to a Unix UID/GID and resolves nested group membership | Read-only bind DN + password |

Security notes:

- With a machine account configured, AD-user NTLM is validated by the Domain Controller —
  **no local NT hash is stored or used**. Without one, domain-user NTLM fails with
  `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`.
- The keytab, the LDAP bind password, and the machine account secret are stored at rest in
  plaintext (write-only, and redacted from API responses). Protect them with filesystem
  permissions equivalent to a keytab file (`chmod 600`).
- The LDAP bind account is read-only; reach the directory over LDAPS or a private network.
- A principal is resolved through the same idmap regardless of the protocol it arrived on,
  so an AD user gets one Unix identity across SMB and NFS.

See [identity.md](/docs/connect/identity) for the provider reference and
[windows-ad-setup.md](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/docs/guide/windows-ad-setup.md) for the end-to-end operator runbook.

## Message integrity and encryption

### SMB signing

DittoFS supports SMB message signing, providing integrity protection against man-in-the-middle
attacks and message tampering.

| Algorithm | Dialect | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| HMAC-SHA256 | SMB 2.x | Legacy |
| AES-128-CMAC | SMB 3.0+ | SP800-108 derived key |
| AES-128-GMAC | SMB 3.1.1 | Preferred; leverages GCM hardware acceleration |

Signing behavior:

- **Enabled** (default `true`): server advertises signing capability during `NEGOTIATE`.
- **Required** (default `false`): when `true`, the server rejects unsigned messages from
  established sessions.

Configure via `dfsctl`, where the two states above are selected by one tri-state flag
(`disabled` | `enabled` | `required`):

```bash
# Advertise signing and reject unsigned messages
./dfsctl adapter settings smb update --signing required

# Advertise signing but still accept unsigned messages (the default)
./dfsctl adapter settings smb update --signing enabled
```

**Recommendation:** set `required: true` for all production deployments to prevent tampering even
when encryption is not used.

### SMB encryption

SMB3 provides AEAD encryption delivering both confidentiality and integrity for all messages on
an encrypted session.

**Supported cipher suites:**

| Cipher | Dialect | Performance |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| AES-128-GCM | 3.1.1 (default) | Fastest (AES-NI + CLMUL) |
| AES-128-CCM | 3.0/3.0.2 (default) | Good (AES-NI) |
| AES-256-GCM | 3.1.1 | Fast, higher security |
| AES-256-CCM | 3.0+ | Highest security AES-CCM variant |

**Encryption modes:**

- **`disabled`**: no encryption. Suitable for testing only. `dfs` logs a startup warning when
  SMB is bound to a non-loopback address in this mode.
- **`preferred`** *(shipped default)*: SMB 3.x sessions are encrypted; SMB 2.x sessions are
  still accepted. Secure by default while remaining wire-compatible with SMB 2.x.
- **`required`**: only encrypted SMB 3.x clients can connect. SMB 2.x clients are rejected at
  `NEGOTIATE`. Recommended for production with sensitive data.

**Per-share encryption:** individual shares can require encryption via `--encrypt-data`
(`dfsctl share create --encrypt-data`). This forces encryption on that tree regardless of the
global mode.

**Recommended production YAML:**

```yaml
adapters:
  smb:
    encryption:
      encryption_mode: required   # reject SMB 2.x; encrypt all SMB 3.x sessions
    signing:
      required: true              # reject unsigned messages
```

See [`../internals/security-model.md`](/docs/contributing/security-model) for cipher/key derivation
internals and the full transport security comparison table.

## Access control

### NFSv4 ACLs

DittoFS supports NFSv4 ACL-based access control with:

- Per-user and per-group access control entries (ACEs)
- Explicit ALLOW and DENY entries evaluated in order
- Granular permission bits (read data, write data, append, execute, delete, read/write
  attributes, read/write ACL, etc.)
- Inheritance flags for directories

ACLs are enforced at the metadata layer. DENY entries take precedence when encountered before a
matching ALLOW entry, following the NFSv4 specification. When both NFSv4 ACLs and POSIX
permissions are present, ACLs take precedence for NFSv4 operations.

### POSIX file permissions

Traditional Unix file permissions are enforced at the metadata layer: owner, group, other
permission bits are checked in that order. When Kerberos is enabled, the Kerberos principal is
mapped to a UID/GID before the permission check.

### Export-level access control

Client access is restricted per share by attaching a **netgroup** — a named list of
IP addresses, CIDR ranges and hostnames. A share with a netgroup accepts only
clients whose address matches a member; a share with no netgroup accepts any
client.

```bash
dfsctl netgroup create trusted-net
dfsctl netgroup add-member trusted-net --type cidr --value 192.168.1.0/24
dfsctl netgroup add-member trusted-net --type ip   --value 192.168.1.50
dfsctl share nfs-config set /export --netgroup trusted-net
```

The netgroup is enforced on both NFS versions, on paths that do not share code:

- **NFSv3** — checked at MOUNT and refused with `MNT3ERR_ACCES`. The check runs
  **only** at mount time; the per-operation path re-checks the auth-flavor
  policy but not the client allowlist.
- **NFSv4** — there is no MOUNT, so the check runs per request instead: when a
  share handle enters a compound (PUTFH, or a LOOKUP crossing an export
  junction out of the pseudo-fs) and again whenever an operation builds an auth
  context. A client outside the allowlist gets `NFS4ERR_ACCESS`.

**Consequence for tightening an export.** Because v4 re-checks per request,
adding or narrowing a netgroup takes effect on a v4 client's next operation,
including one already holding a file handle. On v3 it takes effect for new
mounts only — an already-mounted v3 client keeps working until it remounts.
Remount is what re-reads the allowlist on v3.

Which authentication flavors an export accepts is a separate policy from the
client allowlist. Unlike the address gate, the flavor gate *is* re-checked per
operation on both versions: set it with `--allow-auth-sys` /
`--require-kerberos` on the same `dfsctl share nfs-config set` command, and see
[configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) for the Kerberos floor.

### Identity mapping

Squash mode is a per-share setting (`squash`). The anonymous UID/GID come from
the share's anonymous identity.

It is applied *after* the share grant is resolved and *before* file-level POSIX
and ACL checks. That ordering matters under `all_to_guest`: the share-level
permission is still chosen from the client's original wire identity, and only
the identity used for per-file checks is squashed. If a share grant depends on
the caller being a known user, squashing does not turn that grant into a guest
grant.

All squash — every client's *file-level* identity is anonymous:

```bash
dfsctl share nfs-config set /export --squash all_to_guest
```

Root squash — root (UID 0) is mapped to anonymous for file checks, everyone else passes through:

```bash
dfsctl share nfs-config set /export --squash root_to_guest
```

No squashing — client UIDs pass through unchanged; use only on trusted networks
or with Kerberos:

```bash
dfsctl share nfs-config set /export --squash none
```

The full set of modes is `none`, `root_to_admin`, `root_to_guest`,
`all_to_admin` and `all_to_guest`.

### Read-only shares

```bash
dfsctl share edit /export --read-only true
```

A read-only share fails write and create operations with `EROFS`
(`ErrReadOnly`), distinct from the `EACCES` a permission denial returns.

## Network security

### NFS-over-TLS (RFC 9289)

DittoFS implements the opportunistic `AUTH_TLS` STARTTLS upgrade from RFC 9289: a client sends
a `NULL` RPC with `auth_flavor = AUTH_TLS`, the server replies with the `"STARTTLS"` verifier,
and both perform a TLS 1.3 handshake on the same connection — all subsequent traffic is
encrypted. The handshake runs in userspace (no kernel TLS / `tlshd` on the server). Setting
`client_ca` requires and verifies a client certificate (mutual TLS).

```yaml
adapters:
  nfs:
    tls:
      cert_file: /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.crt
      key_file:  /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.key
      client_ca: /etc/dittofs/tls/ca.crt   # optional — mutual TLS
      mode: opportunistic                   # "opportunistic" (default) | "require"
```

- **`opportunistic`** still serves non-TLS clients in plaintext (smooth rollout).
- **`require`** rejects plaintext connections until they upgrade.
- DittoFS only loads and hot-reloads cert files; issuance and renewal are the platform's
  responsibility.
- **Client support:** Linux `mount -o vers=4.1,xprtsec=tls` needs `tlshd` + `CONFIG_NET_HANDSHAKE`
  (RHEL 9.x / kernel 6.7+). macOS has no NFS-over-TLS client — use Kerberos or a VPN tunnel.

### Control plane API TLS

The control plane REST API (default port `8080`) carries the highest-value credentials in the
system. It binds to `127.0.0.1` (loopback only) by default — a fresh `dfs start` does not
expose credentials off-host.

Any deployment that accepts connections from another machine (multi-host, Kubernetes) should set
`controlplane.host: 0.0.0.0` and pair it with TLS:

```yaml
controlplane:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  tls:
    cert_file: /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.crt
    key_file: /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.key
    client_ca: /etc/dittofs/tls/ca.crt   # optional — mutual TLS
    min_version: "1.2"                    # "1.2" (default) or "1.3"
```

DittoFS loads the files and hot-reloads them on rotation. It does not generate self-signed
certificates or perform ACME. Setting `cert_file` without `key_file` (or vice versa), or
`client_ca` without a server cert, is a fatal startup error.

**Recommended deployment model:**

- **Kubernetes / internet-facing edge:** terminate TLS at an ingress, service mesh, or reverse
  proxy (NGINX) in front of DittoFS.
- **Direct `dfsctl` access / non-Kubernetes hosts:** use DittoFS native TLS or mTLS.

`dfsctl` TLS is captured once at login and reused by every later command:

```bash
# Private CA
dfsctl login --server https://host:port --cacert /etc/dittofs/tls/ca.crt -u admin

# Mutual TLS
dfsctl login --server https://host:port --cacert ca.crt \
    --client-cert client.crt --client-key client.key -u admin

dfsctl share list   # reuses stored CA / client cert — no flags needed
```

The login stores certificate file paths (not contents); each command re-reads them, so
cert-manager rotation is picked up automatically. `--tls-skip-verify` is insecure and intended
only for development against self-signed certs.

See [`./configuration.md`](/docs/getting-started/configuration) for the full option reference.

### Network-level alternatives

Without NFS-over-TLS, NFS data travels in cleartext. Use one of:

1. **WireGuard (recommended):** set up a WireGuard VPN between client and server, then mount
   over the VPN interface.

2. **IPsec:** configure an IPsec tunnel so NFS traffic flows through an encrypted tunnel.

3. **SSH tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ssh -L 12049:localhost:12049 user@server
   sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4,tcp,port=12049 localhost:/export /mnt/test
   ```

### Firewall configuration

Restrict access to DittoFS ports:

```bash
# Linux (iptables)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 12049 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 12049 -j DROP

# Linux (firewalld)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.0/24" port protocol="tcp" port="12049" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# macOS (pf) — add to /etc/pf.conf:
# pass in proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 12049
# block in proto tcp from any to any port 12049
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
```

---

## Kerberos configuration

DittoFS uses a shared Kerberos layer (`pkg/auth/kerberos`) that serves both the NFS (RPCSEC_GSS)
and SMB (SPNEGO) adapters. Configure Kerberos once and both protocols benefit.

### Server configuration

Add the `kerberos` section to your DittoFS config file:

```yaml
kerberos:
  enabled: true
  keytab_path: /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
  service_principal: nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  krb5_conf: /etc/krb5.conf
  max_clock_skew: 5m
  context_ttl: 8h
```

Configuration fields:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable Kerberos authentication | `false` |
| `keytab_path` | Path to the Kerberos keytab file | required when enabled |
| `service_principal` | Service principal name in `service/hostname@REALM` format | required when enabled |
| `krb5_conf` | Path to `krb5.conf` | `/etc/krb5.conf` |
| `max_clock_skew` | Maximum allowed clock difference between client and server | `5m` |
| `context_ttl` | Maximum lifetime of an RPCSEC_GSS security context | `8h` |

### Keytab management

The keytab file contains the service principal's cryptographic key. It must be:

- Readable only by the DittoFS process user
- Stored with restricted permissions (`chmod 600`)
- Rotated periodically per your organization's security policy

DittoFS supports hot-reload of the keytab: when the file is replaced on disk, the server picks
up the new key without a restart.

Create a keytab with MIT Kerberos:

```bash
# On the KDC or using kadmin
kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"
kadmin -q "ktadd -k /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"

chmod 600 /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
chown dittofs:dittofs /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
```

### Environment variable overrides

Useful for container deployments and CI/CD pipelines:

| Environment variable | Config field | Notes |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_KEYTAB` | `keytab_path` | Primary override |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_KEYTAB_PATH` | `keytab_path` | Compatibility alias |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL` | `service_principal` | Primary override |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL` | `service_principal` | Compatibility alias |

### NFS client setup

```bash
# Mount with Kerberos (krb5 security flavor)
sudo mount -t nfs -o sec=krb5,nfsvers=4,tcp,port=12049 server.example.com:/export /mnt/secure

# Verify mount
mount | grep /mnt/secure

# Ensure client has a valid ticket
kinit user@EXAMPLE.COM
klist
```

### SMB client setup

SMB clients that support Kerberos (Windows, smbclient, CIFS kernel module) automatically
negotiate Kerberos via SPNEGO during session setup when the client has a valid TGT.

```bash
# Linux: mount with Kerberos
sudo mount -t cifs -o sec=krb5,vers=3.0 //server.example.com/export /mnt/secure

# smbclient with Kerberos
smbclient -k //server.example.com/export
```

## Production hardening checklist

- [ ] Enable Kerberos authentication for NFS and SMB
- [ ] Enable SMB3 encryption with `encryption_mode: required` for sensitive data
- [ ] Enable SMB message signing with `required: true`
- [ ] Deploy behind VPN or use NFS-over-TLS for NFS data confidentiality
- [ ] Restrict export access by IP address (attach a netgroup to each share)
- [ ] Use root squash on all exports (`squash: root_to_guest`)
- [ ] Configure NFSv4 ACLs for fine-grained access control
- [ ] Use read-only exports where writes are not needed
- [ ] Bind control plane to loopback or behind a reverse proxy with TLS
- [ ] Set keytab permissions to `600`, owned by the DittoFS process user
- [ ] Enable Prometheus metrics and monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Keep DittoFS updated; apply patches promptly

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in DittoFS:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers (see repository for contact).
3. Include: description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested
   fixes if any.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.
