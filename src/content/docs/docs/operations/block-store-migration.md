DittoFS has changed its on-disk/remote block layout twice:

| Layout | Servers | Local | Remote |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Path-indexed (`.blk`) | ≤ v0.15 | `{payloadID}/block-{idx}.blk` | per-block objects |
| Standalone CAS | v0.16 – v0.21 | per-chunk files `blocks/{hh}/{hh}/{hex}` | per-chunk objects `cas/{hh}/{hh}/{hex}` |
| Packed blocks | current | append-only log blobs (`blobs/`) | packed containers `blocks/<id>` |

Current servers store file content as FastCDC chunks (BLAKE3-hashed,
dedup-safe) packed into ~16 MiB block containers. What you need to do
depends on the layout your data is on.

## Standalone CAS (v0.16 – v0.21) → packed blocks: no longer supported

The automatic startup migration has been **removed**. A store still holding
standalone-CAS state cannot be upgraded in place by this build.

The read path no longer understands standalone objects. A chunk locator that
still points at one fails closed with a chunk-not-found error rather than
being repacked, and the `cas/` namespace is neither read nor purged — objects
left there stay, billed and unreachable, until removed by hand
(`aws s3 rm --recursive s3://<bucket>/cas/`).

If you are carrying such a store, stage the upgrade through a release that
still ships the migration, let it converge, and only then move to this build.
Otherwise re-ingest the data.

## Path-indexed `.blk` (≤ v0.15): migrate with an older release first

The offline `migrate-to-cas` command shipped through **v0.21** and has
been removed. A current server still refuses to start against a `.blk`
layout (exit code 78) — but the directive now is:

1. Install dittofs v0.21 (or any v0.16–v0.21 release).
2. Stop the server and run that release's `migrate-to-cas` per its
   documentation (idempotent, resumable, per-share `.cas-migrated-v1`
   sentinel on success).
3. Upgrade to the current release. The automatic cas→blocks conversion
   above finishes the job on first start.

## Upgrading and rolling back

**Every migration above is one-way.** Once a share has been converted, the
release you upgraded from can no longer read it. There is no downgrade
command, and there is no partial-downgrade state to repair.

So: **take a snapshot before you upgrade** — the share's local store
directory and, for remote-backed shares, the bucket/prefix. That snapshot is
the only way back.

The migrations announce themselves. Each one logs a `WARN` naming what it is
about to convert before it touches anything, and long-running ones log
progress every few seconds (payload/chunk counts) so a large store is
visibly working rather than apparently hung. Nothing blocks on an
acknowledgement — an unattended upgrade-and-restart completes on its own.

From this release on, starting an **older** binary against state a newer one
wrote refuses to boot: the server exits **78** (`EX_CONFIG`) and prints the
share path along with both the on-disk format version and the highest this
build reads. Earlier releases had no such check and would open the share and
serve stored files as zeros — right length, no content — which is why the
guard fails closed instead.

If you hit it, no data has been modified. Either:

- reinstall the newer release and start again (the usual case: an accidental
  downgrade or a rollback of the wrong component), or
- restore the pre-upgrade snapshot and start the older release against that.

## Verifying

After the first post-upgrade start:

- The log line `cas→blocks migration complete` reports repacked chunk and
  purged object counts (only printed when there was something to do).
- The remote bucket/prefix should contain no keys under `cas/`.
- Reads verify BLAKE3 end-to-end; any corruption introduced in transit
  fails closed rather than returning wrong bytes.
