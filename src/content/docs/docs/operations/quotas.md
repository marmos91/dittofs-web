DittoFS enforces **per-identity** quotas on a share — by user, by group, or a
default-user fallback — limiting both **bytes** and **inodes (file count)**. Each limit
has a **soft** threshold, a **hard** ceiling, and a **grace** window between them.

> Quotas are managed live on a running server via `dfsctl` (or the REST API). There is no
> config-file or Kubernetes CRD form. The full reference is in
> [Configuration § Shares](/docs/getting-started/configuration#8-shares-exports).

## Set a quota

```bash
# A user (by UID): 10 GiB / 100k files hard, soft at 8 GiB / 90k files,
# 7-day grace (604800s) before the soft byte limit becomes hard.
dfsctl quota set /export --scope user --id 1000 \
    --limit-bytes 10GiB --soft-bytes 8GiB \
    --limit-files 100000 --soft-files 90000 --grace-seconds 604800

# A group (by GID): 50 GiB, no file-count limit.
dfsctl quota set /export --scope group --id 2000 --limit-bytes 50GiB

# Everyone without an explicit quota (fallback template):
dfsctl quota set /export --scope default-user --limit-bytes 5GiB
```

Sizes accept binary units (`GiB`, `MiB`, …). Omit a flag to leave that dimension
unlimited.

## Inspect and remove

```bash
dfsctl quota list /export
dfsctl quota remove /export --scope user --id 1000
```

## How enforcement works

- **Soft → grace → hard.** When an identity crosses its soft threshold, a grace timer
  starts; once the grace window elapses the soft limit is enforced as hard. Drop back
  under soft and the timer resets. Default-user grace is tracked per-user and survives a
  server restart.
- **Most-specific wins.** A user is limited by its own quota if set, else its group's,
  else the default-user fallback.
- **Usage is by owner, within one share.** Bytes and inode counts are keyed by share and
  by file owner UID/GID, and stored durably alongside the files they account for — updated
  in the same transaction that writes the file, and read back at startup rather than
  recomputed, so start-up cost does not grow with the number of files. A `chown` moves a file's
  usage between identities. Shares that name the same metadata store are served by one
  store instance, but their usage is still counted separately: one share's bytes never
  count against another share's quota, and `df` on a share reports only that share.
- **Best-effort.** Under heavy concurrent writes an identity may briefly exceed a limit
  before usage catches up — normal for a userspace NFS/SMB server.

Quota limits live in the control-plane database and are also reachable via the REST API
at `/api/v1/shares/{name}/quotas`.

## Repairing a drifted usage figure

Usage counters are maintained transactionally as files are written and removed, so they
are normally already correct. If a share reports more bytes than its files hold — most
visibly, it refuses writes while `dfsctl share list` shows it far from full — first check
whether the counters really disagree with the file rows:

```bash
dfsctl store metadata recompute-usage /export --dry-run
```

A dry run derives the same figures, changes nothing, and names every usage bucket whose
counter disagrees with the rows, with both numbers, so you can see how far apart they are
and in which direction. A `share` row compares the share's own total rather than one
owner's bucket — that total is what a share quota is checked against and what `df`
reports, and it can drift on its own.

Against a store that is taking writes a dry run reports small transient deltas: the rows
and the counters are read at different instants. Drift from a bug does not look like that
— it persists across runs and does not track live traffic.

Then rebuild the counters from the file rows:

```bash
dfsctl store metadata recompute-usage /export
```

The rebuild scans every file row in the metadata store, so it takes time in proportion to
the store's size, and it repairs every share that store serves rather than only the one
named. Nothing runs it automatically: a per-file walk on every server start would be a
cost every share pays forever to correct a number that is almost always already right.
