## Message Format and Wire Layout

Every SMB2 message follows this structure:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    NetBIOS Session Header                   |
|                         (4 bytes)                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                       SMB2 Header                           |
|                        (64 bytes)                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      Command Body                           |
|                       (variable)                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For SMB3 encrypted messages, a **Transform Header** wraps the entire message:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    NetBIOS Session Header                   |
|                         (4 bytes)                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Transform Header (0xFD534D42)              |
|                        (52 bytes)                           |
|   Signature (16) | Nonce (16) | OrigMsgSize (4)            |
|   Reserved (2) | Flags (2) | SessionID (8)                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                   Encrypted Payload                         |
|            (SMB2 Header + Command Body, encrypted)          |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The **NetBIOS session header** contains a type byte (0x00 for session messages) and a 24-bit
big-endian length. The **SMB2 header** is always 64 bytes and includes the protocol magic
(`0xFE 'S' 'M' 'B'`), command code, credit charge/grant, session ID, tree ID, message ID,
flags, and signature. The **Transform header** uses magic `0xFD 'S' 'M' 'B'` and carries the
AEAD nonce and authentication tag.

---

## Connection Lifecycle

SMB connections follow a multi-phase setup before file operations can begin:

1. **NEGOTIATE** -- Client and server agree on protocol dialect, capabilities, and security
   parameters (cipher suites, signing algorithms, preauth integrity)
2. **SESSION_SETUP** -- Client authenticates (NTLM or Kerberos via SPNEGO), receives a
   SessionID; session keys are derived and encryption/signing activated
3. **TREE_CONNECT** -- Client connects to a specific share, receives a TreeID; per-share
   encryption may be enforced
4. **File Operations** -- CREATE opens a file (returns FileID), then READ/WRITE/CLOSE use
   that FileID
5. **Cleanup** -- CLOSE releases file handles, TREE_DISCONNECT leaves the share, LOGOFF ends
   the session

This is fundamentally different from NFS, where each request is independent and carries its
own auth context.

---

## SMB2 Request Processing

### Message Flow

1. TCP connection accepted
2. NetBIOS session header parsed
3. SMB2 message decoded (decrypted if transform header present)
4. Session/tree context validated
5. Command handler dispatched
6. Handler calls metadata/block stores
7. Response encoded (encrypted if session requires it) and sent

### Request Dispatch

```go
// Per-connection parallel request handling
for {
    msg := readSMB2Message(conn)
    go handleRequest(msg) // Concurrent handling
}
```

### Critical Commands

**Session Management** (`internal/adapter/smb/handlers/`)
- `NEGOTIATE`: Multi-dialect negotiation with negotiate contexts (cipher, signing, preauth)
- `SESSION_SETUP`: NTLM or Kerberos authentication via SPNEGO, key derivation
- `TREE_CONNECT`: Share access with permission validation, per-share encryption enforcement

**File Operations** (`internal/adapter/smb/handlers/`)
- `CREATE`: Create/open files and directories, lease V2 grants, durable handle create contexts
- `READ`: Read file content (with cache support)
- `WRITE`: Write file content (with cache support)
- `CLOSE`: Close file handle and cleanup
- `FLUSH`: Flush cached data to block store
- `QUERY_INFO`: Get file/directory attributes
- `SET_INFO`: Modify attributes, rename, delete
- `QUERY_DIRECTORY`: List directory contents
- `LOCK`: Acquire/release byte-range locks
- `IOCTL`: VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO, server-side copy

```

## Two-Phase Write Pattern

WRITE operations use a two-phase commit pattern:

```go
// 1. Prepare write (validate permissions, get ContentID)
writeOp, err := metadataStore.PrepareWrite(authCtx, handle, newSize)

// 2. Resolve per-share block store and write data
blockStore, _ := rt.GetBlockStoreForHandle(ctx, handle)
blockStore.WriteAt(ctx, writeOp.ContentID, data, offset)

// 3. Commit write (update metadata: size, timestamps)
metadataStore.CommitWrite(authCtx, writeOp)
```

---

## Block Store Integration

SMB handlers use the same per-share block store as NFS, routed through the shared
`internal/adapter/common/` helpers so NFS and SMB share one code path for block-store
resolution and pooled READ:

```go
// Resolve per-share block store from file handle
blockStore, err := common.ResolveForRead(ctx.Context, h.Registry, handle)

// Read path (pooled buffer; release fires after wire write completes)
readResult, err := common.ReadFromBlockStore(ctx.Context, blockStore,
    payloadID, offset, count)
// Response hands readResult.Release to the encoder via SMBResponseBase.ReleaseData

// Write path (data is caller-owned, no Release closure)
err := common.WriteToBlockStore(ctx.Context, blockStore, payloadID, data, offset)

// Commit path (flush + discard *FlushResult)
err := common.CommitBlockStore(ctx.Context, blockStore, payloadID)
```

These three helpers (`ReadFromBlockStore`, `WriteToBlockStore`, `CommitBlockStore`) are the
seam that plumbs `[]BlockRef` into the engine — handler code does not change.

### READ Response Buffer Pool

SMB2 READ responses for regular files allocate the data buffer through `internal/adapter/pool`
(4 KB / 64 KB / 1 MB tiered `sync.Pool`, with a direct-alloc fallback for sizes above
`LargeSize`). The pooled buffer is handed to the response encoder via
`SMBResponseBase.ReleaseData` (a `func()` field); the encoder invokes the closure after
`WriteNetBIOSFrame` returns, safe across plain, encrypted, and compound-response paths.
Non-pooled responses leave `ReleaseData` nil and the encoder null-checks before invoking.

Pipe and symlink READ variants deliberately stay on heap allocations — memcpy overhead with no
reuse benefit for the small buffer sizes involved, and pipes have an ownership model that
conflicts with a pool-managed return buffer. Regression tests
(`TestRead_PipeRead_LeavesReleaseDataNil` / `TestRead_SymlinkRead_...`) guard the non-pool
decision.

---

## Error Mapping

Every `metadata.ErrorCode` is translated to an `NTSTATUS` via
`internal/adapter/common.MapToSMB`, which consumes the same shared table as NFSv3 / NFSv4
(`internal/adapter/common/errmap.go`). Examples:

- `ErrNotFound` → `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND`
- `ErrAlreadyExists` → `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_COLLISION`
- `ErrAccessDenied` / `ErrPermissionDenied` / `ErrAuthRequired` → `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`
  (SMB has no EPERM distinction per MS-ERREF 2.3)
- `ErrIsDirectory` → `STATUS_FILE_IS_A_DIRECTORY`
- `ErrStaleHandle` → `STATUS_FILE_CLOSED`

### Lock-Context vs General-Context Divergence

Lock-operation errors (SMB2 LOCK requests) use a separate accessor `common.MapLockToSMB`
backed by `internal/adapter/common/lock_errmap.go`. The divergence matters:
**`ErrLocked` in lock context → `STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED`; `ErrLocked` in general READ/WRITE
I/O context → `STATUS_FILE_LOCK_CONFLICT`**. Clients react differently to the two codes
(retry-later vs. hard-fail-with-indication), so the distinction is wire-visible.

See `internal/adapter/common/lock_errmap.go` for the full lock-context override table.

### Wrapped Error Unwrapping

`common.MapToSMB` uses `errors.As`, so wrapped `StoreError` values
(`fmt.Errorf("context: %w", storeErr)`) unwrap correctly. Prior to v0.15.0 the SMB handler
used an unwrapped type assertion that failed on wrapped errors and fell through to
`STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` — the consolidation fixed that latent bug.

---

## Credit Flow Control

SMB2 uses credits (MS-SMB2 3.3.1.2) as the protocol-level flow-control mechanism. Each
request consumes credits equal to its `CreditCharge`; each response grants credits via the
`CreditResponse` header field. The client tracks a per-connection running balance
(`cur_credits`) and will refuse to send a request once its balance would go negative, or
reject a response whose grant would overflow its 16-bit counter. Both outcomes look like
`NT_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` or `NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE` on the wire, so credit
accounting must be byte-for-byte consistent between the server's window and the client's
counter.

### Defaults

```go
type CreditConfig struct {
    MinGrant          uint16  // Minimum credits per response (1)
    MaxGrant          uint16  // Maximum credits per response (8192)
    InitialGrant      uint16  // Floor when client requests 0 (1)
    MaxSessionCredits uint32  // Per-connection window cap (8192)
}
```

The defaults match Samba's server (`smb2 max credits = 8192`, initial grant = 1 in
`source3/smbd/smb2_server.c`) and Windows Server 2008R2+. These are the protocol-level
invariants clients expect; tuning them higher can break interoperability.

### Server Data Structure: `CommandSequenceWindow`

One per connection. Tracks granted message IDs as a sliding bitmap
(`internal/adapter/smb/session/sequence_window.go`):

```
low           high
 │    span=high-low    │
 ▼                     ▼
[0111100011001110000...]  bit i = sequence (low+i) is granted-and-unconsumed
                           set by Grant, cleared by Consume

available   = the server's view of the client's cur_credits
              (initially equal to popcount(bitmap); decoupled by Reclaim)
```

Three invariants drive correctness:

1. **`available` mirrors the client's `cur_credits`.** Every `Grant(N)` increments `available`
   by the amount the server actually extended the window; every `Consume(msgId, charge)`
   decrements `available` by `charge`. The server never grants more than
   `MaxSessionCredits - available`, so the client's counter can never overflow.
2. **`low` advances lazily in 64-bit blocks.** `advanceLow` reclaims bitmap words once an
   entire 64-sequence run has been consumed. The `available` counter is the authoritative
   credit tally; the bitmap span (`high - low`) can briefly exceed `available` when the oldest
   unconsumed bit is still in place, but stays bounded because `available` gates new grants.
3. **Credit-exempt commands still consume sequence numbers.** MS-SMB2 exempts `NEGOTIATE`,
   `CANCEL`, and the first `SESSION_SETUP` (`SessionID=0`) from credit *validation*, but the
   client still advances its msgId and decrements `cur_credits` for them. The server therefore
   MUST call `Consume` on those messages too — otherwise `available` drifts up by one per
   credit-exempt request, saturates at `MaxSessionCredits`, and future responses carry
   `credits=0` until the client runs out of credits (observed in issue #378).

#### Reclaim: Compound Response Zeroing

MS-SMB2 3.2.4.1.4 requires middle responses in a compound to advertise `Credits=0`. Our
response builder grants credits atomically before the write (see below), so after zeroing the
middle headers the window would be over-extended relative to what the client was told.
`Reclaim(n)` decrements `available` by `n` without touching the bitmap — the reclaimed message
IDs remain valid on the server (a misbehaving client that sent one would still pass Consume),
but the client was never told about them and will not use them under normal operation. `Consume`
saturates `available` at zero rather than underflowing if a reclaimed message ID is used
anyway.

#### Grant Path: Atomic, Pre-Write

```
GrantCredits (per-session policy)   →  credits (requested grant)
  └─ strategy-dependent (echo/fixed/adaptive)

CommandSequenceWindow.Grant(credits) →  credits' (may be less; ≤ MaxSessionCredits - available)
  └─ extends the window and updates `available` atomically under w.mu

respHeader.Credits = credits'
...send response...
```

The grant is recorded against the window **before** the response is written, and the grant
function returns the actual amount extended, so the value advertised in `hdr.Credits` is
always exactly what the window was extended by. This closes the TOCTOU gap that a "read
`Remaining()`, clamp, write, then `Grant()`" pattern would leave open when pipelined responses
run on the same connection. All response build sites funnel through `grantConnectionCredits`
in `internal/adapter/smb/response.go`.

#### Strategies

- **Echo** (default): grant what the client requests, bounded by `[MinGrant, MaxGrant]` and
  `Remaining()`. Matches Samba's `smb2_set_operation_credit`:
  `grant = credit_charge + (requested - 1)`.
- **Fixed**: always grant `InitialGrant`.
- **Adaptive**: `InitialGrant` scaled by live load and client-outstanding factors. More
  aggressive than Echo, primarily useful when throughput matters more than strict Samba interop.

#### Interoperability Notes

- **Samba client** hard-caps `cur_credits` at `uint16` max (65535) and rejects any response
  that would overflow. Prior to #378 we advertised ~384 credits per response (InitialGrant=256
  x adaptive 1.5x boost), which saturated the client after ~85 SESSION_SETUP iterations and
  triggered `NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE`. The fix lowered defaults to
  Samba-compatible values and enforced `Remaining()` clamping at every response build site.
- **Windows client** is more tolerant but grants are capped by the negotiated
  `Connection.MaxCredits`; setting `MaxSessionCredits > 8192` gains nothing because Windows
  caps at 8192 by default too.
- **Multi-credit operations** (large READ/WRITE) consume `CreditCharge` sequence numbers per
  request; the window handles charge > 1 natively.

## SMB3 Dialect Negotiation Details

### Dialect Selection

The NEGOTIATE request contains a list of dialect revisions supported by the client. The server
selects the highest dialect both sides support:

| Priority | Dialect | Hex | Key Capability |
|----------|---------|-----|----------------|
| 1 (highest) | SMB 3.1.1 | 0x0311 | Preauth integrity, negotiate contexts |
| 2 | SMB 3.0.2 | 0x0302 | VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO |
| 3 | SMB 3.0 | 0x0300 | Encryption (AES-CCM), CMAC signing |
| 4 (lowest) | SMB 2.0.2 | 0x0202 | Basic SMB2 operations |

### Negotiate Contexts (SMB 3.1.1)

When the negotiated dialect is 3.1.1, both client and server exchange **negotiate contexts**
that specify security parameters:

**SMB2_PREAUTH_INTEGRITY_CAPABILITIES:**
- Hash algorithm: SHA-512 (mandatory)
- Salt: random 32-byte value per side
- Purpose: preauth integrity hash chain for downgrade protection

**SMB2_ENCRYPTION_CAPABILITIES:**
- Supported ciphers in preference order
- Server selects the first mutually supported cipher

**SMB2_SIGNING_CAPABILITIES:**
- Supported signing algorithms in preference order
- Server selects the first mutually supported algorithm

### Preauth Integrity Hash Chain

For SMB 3.1.1, a running SHA-512 hash is computed over the raw NEGOTIATE and SESSION_SETUP
request/response bytes:

```
PreauthHash[0] = SHA-512(Salt || NEGOTIATE_REQUEST_bytes)
PreauthHash[1] = SHA-512(PreauthHash[0] || NEGOTIATE_RESPONSE_bytes)
PreauthHash[2] = SHA-512(PreauthHash[1] || SESSION_SETUP_REQUEST_bytes)
...
```

This hash chain serves as the KDF context for key derivation (see [Key Derivation](#key-derivation-sp800-108)), binding the session keys to the exact negotiate exchange. Any man-in-the-middle modification of the negotiate messages produces different keys, causing authentication to fail.

### Server Cipher and Signing Preference

DittoFS uses the following default preference order:

**Cipher preference** (configurable):
1. AES-128-GCM (0x0002) -- fastest on modern hardware with AES-NI
2. AES-128-CCM (0x0001) -- fallback for 3.0/3.0.2
3. AES-256-GCM (0x0004) -- higher security, slightly slower
4. AES-256-CCM (0x0003) -- highest security AES-CCM variant

**Signing preference** (configurable):
1. AES-128-GMAC (0x0002) -- fastest for 3.1.1
2. AES-128-CMAC (0x0001) -- required for 3.0+
3. HMAC-SHA256 -- legacy for 2.x clients

### FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO (Downgrade Protection)

For SMB 3.0 and 3.0.2 (which lack the preauth integrity hash chain), the client sends an
`FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO` IOCTL after tree connect. The server validates that the
negotiate parameters match what was originally negotiated:

- Client sends: Capabilities, GUID, SecurityMode, requested Dialects
- Server compares against stored negotiate state
- If any field mismatches: **connection is dropped** (potential MITM downgrade)
- For SMB 3.1.1: this IOCTL is not needed (preauth hash provides stronger protection).
  DittoFS drops the TCP connection if a 3.1.1 client sends it, per MS-SMB2 Section 3.3.5.15.12.

### Wire Format: Negotiate Request

NEGOTIATE Request (variable):
  StructureSize:     36
  DialectCount:      N (number of dialects)

  Reserved:          0
  Capabilities:      flags

  NegContextCount:   number of contexts (3.1.1 only)
  Dialects[]:        array of uint16 dialect revisions
  NegContextList[]:  padded negotiate context structures (3.1.1 only)
```

### Dialect Configuration

```yaml
adapters:
  smb:
    # Dialect selection (optional, default: all supported)
    min_dialect: "3.0"     # Reject clients below this dialect
    max_dialect: "3.1.1"   # Maximum dialect to negotiate
```

## Encryption Internals

### Transform Header

Encrypted messages use the `0xFD 'S' 'M' 'B'` magic (vs `0xFE 'S' 'M' 'B'` for unencrypted):

```
Transform Header (52 bytes):
  ProtocolID:         0xFD534D42 (4 bytes)
  Signature:          AES-GCM/CCM authentication tag (16 bytes)
  Nonce:              AES-GCM/CCM nonce (16 bytes, left-padded with zeros)
  OriginalMessageSize: uint32 (4 bytes)
  Reserved:           uint16 (2 bytes)
  Flags:              uint16 (2 bytes) -- 0x0001 = encrypted
  SessionId:          uint64 (8 bytes)
```

The **AAD (Additional Authenticated Data)** for the AEAD cipher is the 20 bytes of the
transform header starting from the Nonce field through SessionId (bytes 20-51). This ensures
the session binding and message size cannot be tampered with.

### Cipher Suites

| Cipher | ID | Default For | Key Size | Nonce Size | Tag Size |
|--------|-----|-------------|----------|------------|----------|
| AES-128-CCM | 0x0001 | SMB 3.0, 3.0.2 | 128-bit | 11 bytes | 16 bytes |
| AES-128-GCM | 0x0002 | SMB 3.1.1 | 128-bit | 12 bytes | 16 bytes |
| AES-256-CCM | 0x0003 | -- | 256-bit | 11 bytes | 16 bytes |
| AES-256-GCM | 0x0004 | -- | 256-bit | 12 bytes | 16 bytes |

**AES-GCM** is preferred for SMB 3.1.1 due to hardware acceleration (AES-NI + CLMUL) on
modern CPUs. **AES-CCM** is the mandatory cipher for SMB 3.0 and 3.0.2 compatibility.

### Encryption Enforcement Details

**Per-session encryption** (`Session.EncryptData`): When mode is `required`, sessions
negotiating SMB 3.x have `SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA` set in the SESSION_SETUP response
and all subsequent messages on the session are encrypted. When mode is `preferred`, AEAD keys
are still derived for SMB 3.x sessions (so per-share encryption can use them), but the session
flag is **not** set — whole-session message encryption is only enforced in `required` mode or
for shares with `encrypt_data=true`.

**Per-share encryption** (`Share.EncryptData`): Individual shares can require encryption via
the `encrypt_data` flag in share configuration. When set,
`SMB2_SHAREFLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA` is returned in TREE_CONNECT response.

**Guest sessions**: Never encrypted because guest sessions have no session key for key
derivation.

## Signing Internals

### Signing Algorithms by Dialect

| Dialect | Algorithm | Key Derivation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| SMB 2.0.2 | HMAC-SHA256 | Direct from session key |
| SMB 3.0 | AES-128-CMAC | SP800-108 KDF |
| SMB 3.0.2 | AES-128-CMAC | SP800-108 KDF |
| SMB 3.1.1 | AES-128-GMAC (preferred) or AES-128-CMAC | SP800-108 KDF with preauth hash |

**AES-128-GMAC** is the preferred signing algorithm for SMB 3.1.1 because it leverages the
same GCM hardware acceleration as encryption. If a 3.1.1 client omits the
SIGNING_CAPABILITIES negotiate context, the server defaults to AES-128-CMAC per specification.

### Signing Algorithm Selection

The signing algorithm is determined by the negotiated dialect and negotiate contexts:

1. **SMB 2.0.2**: Always HMAC-SHA256 (no negotiation)
2. **SMB 3.0/3.0.2**: Always AES-128-CMAC (no negotiation)
3. **SMB 3.1.1 with SIGNING_CAPABILITIES**: First mutually supported algorithm from server
   preference list
4. **SMB 3.1.1 without SIGNING_CAPABILITIES**: Default to AES-128-CMAC

### SP800-108 Counter Mode KDF for Signing Keys

For SMB 3.0+, the signing key is derived from the session key using NIST SP800-108 in Counter
Mode with HMAC-SHA256 as the PRF:

```
SigningKey = KDF(SessionKey, Label, Context)

Where:
  PRF = HMAC-SHA256
  Key = SessionKey (from authentication)
  Label = "SMBSigningKey\0" (null-terminated)
  Context = varies by dialect (see Key Derivation section)
```

### When Signing Is Required vs Optional

- **NEGOTIATE**: Never signed (no session key yet)
- **SESSION_SETUP**: Final response can be signed (to prove server identity)
- **After SESSION_SETUP**: All messages signed when signing is enabled for the session
- **Encrypted messages**: Signing is redundant when encryption is active (AEAD provides
  integrity), but DittoFS still signs to match Windows Server behaviour

---

## Key Derivation (SP800-108)

### Algorithm

SMB3 uses NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode KDF with HMAC-SHA256 as the PRF to derive per-purpose
cryptographic keys from the session key obtained during authentication.

```
KDF-HMAC-SHA256(Key, Label, Context):
  i = 1
  L = keyLength * 8 (in bits)
  result = PRF(Key, i || Label || 0x00 || Context || L)
  return result[0:keyLength]
```

Where `||` denotes concatenation and `PRF` is HMAC-SHA256.

### Key Purposes

Four keys are derived per session:

| Key | Label (null-terminated) | Usage |
|-----|------------------------|-------|
| SigningKey | `"SMBSigningKey\0"` | Message signing (HMAC/CMAC/GMAC) |
| EncryptionKey | `"SMBS2CCipherKey\0"` (3.0) / `"SMBServerEncryptionKey\0"` (3.1.1) | Server-to-client encryption |
| DecryptionKey | `"SMBC2SCipherKey\0"` (3.0) / `"SMBClientEncryptionKey\0"` (3.1.1) | Client-to-server decryption |
| ApplicationKey | `"SMBAppKey\0"` | Application-level use |

### Context by Dialect

| Dialect | KDF Context |
|---------|-------------|
| SMB 3.0 | `"SmbSign\0"` / `"ServerIn \0"` / `"ServerOut\0"` (fixed strings) |
| SMB 3.0.2 | Same as 3.0 |
| SMB 3.1.1 | Preauth integrity hash value (SHA-512 hash chain output) |

The use of the preauth integrity hash as KDF context in 3.1.1 is critical for security: it
cryptographically binds the derived keys to the exact negotiate exchange, preventing downgrade
attacks where a MITM strips security capabilities.

### Key Length

For 128-bit ciphers (AES-128-GCM, AES-128-CCM, AES-128-CMAC, AES-128-GMAC), the derived key
is 16 bytes. For 256-bit ciphers (AES-256-GCM, AES-256-CCM), the derived key is 32 bytes; the
session key is required to be at least 32 bytes (achieved by hashing with SHA-256 if needed).

## Lease State Machine and Epoch Internals

### Lease V2 vs V1

| Feature | Lease V1 (SMB 2.1) | Lease V2 (SMB 3.0+) |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ParentLeaseKey | Not available | Links child to parent directory lease |
| Epoch | Not available | Monotonic counter for stale break detection |
| Directory Leases | Not supported | Read-caching on directories |
| Create Context | SMB2_CREATE_REQUEST_LEASE | SMB2_CREATE_REQUEST_LEASE_V2 |

### Lease State Machine

```
Grant:    None -> R (shared read)
          None -> RWH (exclusive, single opener)

Break:    RWH -> RH  (another client opens for read)
          RWH -> None (another client opens for write)
          RH  -> R   (handle caching revoked)
          R   -> None (all caching revoked)
```

Break is initiated by the server when a conflicting open arrives. The original client must
acknowledge the break and flush cached data before the new open proceeds.

### Epoch-Based Stale Break Prevention

Each lease V2 has a monotonic **epoch** counter that increments on every state change. When a
lease break notification is sent, it includes the current epoch. If the client sends a break
acknowledgment with a stale epoch (lower than current), the server knows the client missed an
intermediate break and can take corrective action.

### ParentLeaseKey

Lease V2 includes a `ParentLeaseKey` that associates the file's lease with its parent
directory's lease. When a file operation triggers a directory lease break, the server can
identify which parent directory leases need to be broken by matching `ParentLeaseKey` values.

### Directory Lease Internals

Directory leases grant Read-caching on a directory, allowing the client to cache directory
listings locally:

- **Granted**: When a client opens a directory with a lease V2 create context
- **Cached data**: QUERY_DIRECTORY results are cached client-side
- **Break trigger**: Any modification to the directory's contents (create, delete, rename)
- **Break target**: Always breaks to None (directory leases only support Read state)

Directory lease breaks are triggered by the `MetadataService` when `CreateFile`, `RemoveFile`,
or `Rename` modifies a directory. The break flows through the
`LockManager.CheckAndBreakDirectoryCaching()` method.

---

## Durable Handle Validation and Wire Format

### Durable Handle V1 (DHnQ/DHnC)

V1 durable handles (SMB 2.0.2+) require a batch oplock:

- **DHnQ (Durable Handle Request)**: Client requests a durable handle in CREATE
- **DHnC (Durable Handle Reconnect)**: Client reconnects to a preserved handle
- **Requirement**: The file must have been opened with a batch oplock grant
- **Limitation**: No idempotent reconnection (duplicate reconnects may fail)

### Durable Handle V2 (DH2Q/DH2C)

V2 durable handles (SMB 3.0+) add `CreateGuid` for idempotent reconnection:

- **DH2Q (Durable Handle V2 Request)**: Client provides a `CreateGuid` (16-byte GUID)
- **DH2C (Durable Handle V2 Reconnect)**: Client provides `CreateGuid` for matching
- **No oplock requirement**: V2 handles do not require batch oplock
- **Idempotent**: Multiple reconnect attempts with the same `CreateGuid` succeed
- **Precedence**: When both V1 and V2 create contexts are present, V2 takes precedence per
  MS-SMB2

### Reconnect Validation

V2 reconnect performs 14+ validation checks per MS-SMB2 specification:

1. Look up handle by `CreateGuid`
2. Verify handle is in disconnected/durable state
3. Verify requesting user matches original creator
4. Verify file name matches
5. Verify session key hash matches (SHA-256 of signing key)
6. Verify share name matches
7. Verify handle has not timed out
8. Verify no conflicting opens exist
9. ... (additional checks per spec)

If all checks pass, the handle is restored to the new session. The `IsDurable` flag is NOT set
on the restored handle -- the client must re-request durability after reconnect.

### Handle Timeout and Scavenger

- **Default timeout**: 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Scavenger interval**: Periodic background goroutine scans for expired handles
- **Cleanup**: Expired handles are cleaned up (pending I/O cancelled, locks released, handle
  removed from store)
- **Scavenger lifecycle**: Tied to `Serve` context -- stops automatically on adapter shutdown

### App Instance ID

V2 durable handles support an optional **App Instance ID** (16-byte GUID) for cluster failover
scenarios. When a client reconnects from a different cluster node with the same App Instance
ID, the server can close the old handle and transfer state to the new session.

### Wire Format: Create Context

```
DH2Q Create Context (Durable Handle V2 Request):
  Timeout:        uint32 (requested timeout in milliseconds)
  Flags:          uint32 (PERSISTENT flag for persistent handles)
  Reserved:       8 bytes
  CreateGuid:     16 bytes (client-generated GUID)

DH2C Create Context (Durable Handle V2 Reconnect):
  FileId:         16 bytes (persistent + volatile)
  CreateGuid:     16 bytes (must match original DH2Q)
  Flags:          uint32
```

## Kerberos and SPNEGO Flow

### SPNEGO Negotiation Flow

```
Client                              Server
  |                                    |
  |--- NEGOTIATE (SecurityBuffer) ---->|
  |<-- NEGOTIATE Response (mechTypes) -|
  |                                    |
  |--- SESSION_SETUP (SPNEGO Init) --->|
  |    Contains: mechToken (AP-REQ)    |
  |    or NTLM Negotiate               |
  |                                    |
  |<-- SESSION_SETUP Response ---------|
  |    Contains: mechToken (AP-REP)    |
  |    or NTLM Challenge               |
  |    Status: MORE_PROCESSING (NTLM)  |
  |    or SUCCESS (Kerberos)           |
  |                                    |
  [NTLM only: additional round-trip]   |
  |--- SESSION_SETUP (NTLM Auth) ----->|
  |<-- SESSION_SETUP (SUCCESS) --------|
```

The SPNEGO wrapper advertises both Kerberos and NTLM mechanism OIDs. Clients with valid
Kerberos tickets choose Kerberos for single round-trip authentication.

### Kerberos Session Setup

1. **Client** obtains TGT from KDC, then requests service ticket for
   `cifs/server.example.com@REALM`
2. **Client** sends AP-REQ inside SPNEGO InitToken in SESSION_SETUP
3. **Server** validates AP-REQ against keytab, extracts session key
4. **Server** sends AP-REP (mutual authentication) inside SPNEGO Response
5. **Session key** from Kerberos is used as input to SP800-108 KDF for signing/encryption keys

### Session Key Extraction for KDF

The Kerberos session key (from AP-REQ validation) becomes the **base session key** for the
SP800-108 KDF. This key is then used to derive:
- SigningKey (for AES-CMAC/GMAC message signing)
- EncryptionKey (for AES-GCM/CCM encryption)
- DecryptionKey (for AES-GCM/CCM decryption)

### NTLM Fallback

When Kerberos is not available (no keytab configured, client has no valid TGT, or DNS
resolution fails), the server falls back to NTLM authentication:

1. Client sends NTLM Negotiate message
2. Server responds with NTLM Challenge
3. Client sends NTLM Authenticate with NTProofStr
4. Server validates credentials: **local users** are checked against the stored NT hash;
   **AD domain users** are validated by forwarding the challenge/response to the Domain
   Controller over a sealed NETLOGON secure channel (requires a configured machine account)

NTLM provides weaker security than Kerberos: no mutual authentication, vulnerable to relay
attacks, and the session key is derived from the password hash rather than a fresh Kerberos
session key.

### Guest Sessions

When authentication fails and guest access is enabled:
- Session is created with guest privileges
- **No signing**: Guest sessions cannot sign messages (no session key)
- **No encryption**: Guest sessions cannot be encrypted (no key for KDF)
- Security implications: guest access should be limited to read-only public shares

---

## Cross-Protocol Behaviour

DittoFS supports simultaneous NFS and SMB access to the same files and directories. This
section documents how the protocols interact through the unified LockManager in
`pkg/metadata/lock/`.

### Cross-Protocol Behaviour Matrix

The following table shows what happens when an operation from one protocol encounters active
caching state from the other protocol:

**NFS operation encountering SMB state:**

| NFS Operation | SMB Read Lease (R) | SMB Write Lease (RW/RWH) | SMB Dir Lease |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| **READ** | Coexists | Break to None, wait for ack | -- |
| **WRITE** | Break to None | Break to None, wait for ack | -- |
| **CREATE** | -- | -- | Break directory lease |
| **REMOVE** | Break to None | Break to None, wait for ack | Break directory lease |
| **RENAME** | Break to None (src + dst) | Break to None, wait for ack | Break both src and dst dir leases |
| **LINK** | -- | -- | Break target directory lease |
| **SETATTR (file)** | -- | Break to None | -- |
| **OPEN (delegation grant)** | Check coexistence | Conflict: break lease first | -- |

**SMB operation encountering NFS state:**

| SMB Operation | NFS Read Deleg | NFS Write Deleg | NFS Dir Deleg |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **CREATE (read)** | Coexists | CB_RECALL, wait | -- |
| **CREATE (write)** | CB_RECALL, wait | CB_RECALL, wait | -- |
| **WRITE** | CB_RECALL, wait | CB_RECALL, wait | -- |
| **DELETE** | CB_RECALL, wait | CB_RECALL, wait | -- |
| **RENAME** | CB_RECALL (src + dst) | CB_RECALL, wait | CB_RECALL both dirs |
| **CREATE (in dir)** | -- | -- | CB_RECALL + CB_NOTIFY |
| **DELETE (in dir)** | -- | -- | CB_RECALL + CB_NOTIFY |
| **QUERY_DIR (lease req)** | -- | -- | Check coexistence |

### Coexistence Rules

| NFS State | SMB State | Result | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Read delegation | Read lease (R) | **Coexist** | Both are read-only caching; no data conflict |
| Read delegation | Write lease (RW/RWH) | **Conflict** | Write lease allows cached writes that read delegation won't see |
| Write delegation | Any lease | **Conflict** | Write delegation implies exclusive write caching |
| Any delegation | Write lease | **Conflict** | Write lease implies exclusive write caching |
| Dir delegation | Dir lease | **Coexist** | Both are read-only directory caching |

### Break Flow: SMB Write Triggers NFS Delegation Recall

```
SMB Client                    LockManager                     NFS Client

    |                              |                               |
    |                              |<---- DELEGRETURN -------------|
    |                              |   delegation removed          |
    |<-- CREATE response ----------|                               |
```

### Break Flow: NFS Open Triggers SMB Lease Break

```
NFS Client                    LockManager                     SMB Client
    |                              |                               |

    |                              |   lease downgraded/removed    |
    |<-- OPEN response ------------|                               |
```

### Directory Change Coordination

When a file is created, deleted, or renamed, the MetadataService triggers directory caching
breaks for the parent directory:

```
Any Client                    MetadataService               LockManager
    |                              |                              |
    |-- CREATE file in /dir ------>|                              |
    |                              |-- notifyDirChange("/dir") -->|
    |                              |                              |
    |                              |   CheckAndBreakDirectoryCaching:
    |                              |   1. Break SMB dir leases    |
    |                              |   2. Break NFS dir delegations
    |                              |   3. Queue DirNotification   |
    |                              |      (type=Add, name=file)   |
    |                              |                              |
    |                              |   Consumers:                 |
    |                              |   - SMB: CHANGE_NOTIFY       |
    |                              |   - NFS: CB_NOTIFY           |
```

**RENAME across directories** breaks both source and target directory leases and delegations.

### Anti-Storm Mechanism

To prevent rapid grant-break-grant-break cycles (lease/delegation storms), the LockManager
maintains a unified `recentlyBrokenCache` with a configurable TTL (default 30 seconds):

1. When a lease or delegation is broken, the file handle is marked in the cache
2. Subsequent lease/delegation grant requests check the cache
3. If the handle was recently broken, the grant is denied (client retries later)
4. The TTL applies cross-protocol: an NFS delegation broken due to SMB activity prevents NFS
   re-grant for the TTL duration, and vice versa

### Notification Queue

Directory change notifications are queued in a bounded notification queue owned by the
LockManager:

- **Capacity**: 1024 events per directory (configurable)
- **Overflow**: Collapses to a single "full rescan needed" event
- **Flush**: Triggered by size threshold (100 events) or time threshold (500ms)
- **Consumers**: NFS adapter drains into CB_NOTIFY; SMB adapter drains into CHANGE_NOTIFY
- **Event types**: Add, Remove, Rename, Modify (with entry name and old/new names for rename)

### Hidden Files

Hidden files are handled differently between Unix and Windows:

- **Unix convention**: Files starting with `.` are hidden
- **Windows convention**: Files with the Hidden attribute flag are hidden

DittoFS bridges both conventions:
- Dot-prefix files (`.gitignore`, `.DS_Store`) appear with `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` in SMB
  listings
- The `Hidden` attribute can also be explicitly set via SMB `SET_INFO` (FileBasicInformation)
- Both conventions are persisted: dot-prefix detection is automatic, explicit Hidden flag is
  stored in metadata

### Special Files (FIFO, Socket, Device Nodes)

Unix special files (FIFO, socket, block device, character device) have no meaningful
representation in SMB:

- **Via NFS**: Full support -- MKNOD creates, GETATTR returns correct type
- **Via SMB**: Hidden from directory listings entirely

This behaviour matches commercial NAS devices (Synology, QNAP) which typically do not expose
special files via SMB.

### Symlinks

Symlinks are handled transparently via MFsymlink format:

- **NFS-created symlinks**: Appear as MFsymlink files (1067 bytes) when read via SMB
- **SMB-created symlinks**: MFsymlink files are automatically converted to real symlinks on
  CLOSE
- Both NFS and SMB clients can follow symlinks correctly

---

## Byte-Range Locking

DittoFS implements SMB2 byte-range locking per [MS-SMB2] 2.2.26/2.2.27.

### Lock Types

- **Shared (Read) Locks**: Multiple clients can hold shared locks on overlapping ranges
- **Exclusive (Write) Locks**: Only one client can hold an exclusive lock on a range

### Lock Behaviour

```go
// Lock request processing
for each lockElement in request.Locks {
    if lockElement.Flags & UNLOCK {
        // Release lock - NOT rolled back on batch failure
        store.UnlockFile(handle, sessionID, offset, length)
    } else {
        // Acquire lock - rolled back if later operation fails
        store.LockFile(handle, lock)
        acquiredLocks = append(acquiredLocks, lockElement)
    }
}
```

### Lock Enforcement

Locks are enforced on READ/WRITE operations:
- **READ**: Blocked by another session's exclusive lock on overlapping range
- **WRITE**: Blocked by any other session's lock (shared or exclusive) on overlapping range

Same-session locks never block the owning session's I/O operations.

### Lock Lifetime

Locks are ephemeral (in-memory only) and persist until:
- Explicitly released via LOCK with SMB2_LOCKFLAG_UNLOCK
- File handle is closed (CLOSE command)
- Session disconnects (LOGOFF or connection drop)
- Server restarts (all locks lost)

### Atomicity Limitations

Per SMB2 specification ([MS-SMB2] 2.2.26):

1. **Unlock operations are NOT rolled back**: If a batch LOCK request includes unlocks and a
   later lock acquisition fails, the successful unlocks remain in effect.

2. **Lock type changes**: When re-locking an existing range with a different type (shared to
   exclusive), rollback removes the lock entirely rather than reverting to the original type.

## Opportunistic Locks

DittoFS implements SMB2 opportunistic locks per [MS-SMB2] 2.2.14, 2.2.23, 2.2.24.

### Oplock Levels

- **None (0x00)**: No caching allowed
- **Level II (0x01)**: Shared read caching -- multiple clients can cache read data
- **Exclusive (0x08)**: Exclusive read/write caching -- single client can cache reads and
  writes
- **Batch (0x09)**: Like Exclusive with handle caching -- client can delay close operations

### How Oplocks Work

1. **Grant**: Client requests oplock level in CREATE request
2. **Cache**: Client caches file data according to granted level
3. **Break**: When another client opens the file, server sends OPLOCK_BREAK notification
4. **Acknowledge**: Original client flushes cached data and acknowledges break

### Oplock Behaviour

```go
// Level II allows multiple readers (first holder tracked)
clientA opens file -> granted Level II
clientB opens file (Level II) -> granted Level II (coexistence)

// Exclusive/Batch requires break on conflict
clientA opens file -> granted Exclusive
clientB opens file -> server initiates break to Level II
                   -> clientB gets None (must retry after break)
```

When an oplock break is initiated, the conflicting client is not granted an oplock immediately.
It must retry after the break acknowledgment.

### Current Limitations

- **Leases preferred**: SMB3 clients should use Lease V2 instead of traditional oplocks
- **In-memory tracking**: Oplock state is lost on server restart
- **Single holder tracking**: Only tracks one Level II holder (others coexist but are not
  tracked)

## Change Notifications

DittoFS implements CHANGE_NOTIFY support per [MS-SMB2] 2.2.35/2.2.36, with directory change
events delivered through the unified notification queue.

### Current Status

The implementation accepts CHANGE_NOTIFY requests and delivers change events through the
LockManager's notification queue:

- **Watch Registration**: Clients can register directory watches with completion filters
- **Change Detection**: CREATE, CLOSE (delete-on-close), SET_INFO (rename), and
  cross-protocol operations trigger change events
- **Notification Queue**: Events are queued and delivered to registered watchers via the
  LockManager

### How It Works

```
Client registers CHANGE_NOTIFY -> STATUS_PENDING
  |
MetadataService detects change -> LockManager.notifyDirChange()
  |
LockManager queues DirNotification -> flush to registered consumers
  |
SMB adapter delivers CHANGE_NOTIFY response with FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION
```

### Completion Filter Support

The following filters are recognized:

| Filter | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_FILE_NAME | 0x0001 | File create/delete/rename |
| FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_DIR_NAME | 0x0002 | Directory create/delete/rename |
| FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_ATTRIBUTES | 0x0004 | Attribute changes |
| FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_SIZE | 0x0008 | File size changes |
| FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_LAST_WRITE | 0x0010 | Last write time changes |

### Future Work

Full async notification delivery requires:
1. Connection-level async response infrastructure
2. Message ID tracking for pending requests
3. Proper SMB2 async response framing
