## Windows VM setup

**Last validated:** 2026-02-28 (Windows 11 24H2)

### Option A: UTM (Apple Silicon, recommended)

UTM is the recommended VM solution for Apple Silicon Macs running DittoFS.

1. Download and install UTM from [mac.getutm.app](https://mac.getutm.app/).
2. Download the Windows 11 ARM ISO from [Microsoft UUP dump](https://uupdump.net/) or the
   official Microsoft site.
3. Create a new VM:
   - Click "Create a New Virtual Machine" > "Virtualize".
   - Select "Windows".
   - Allocate at least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.
   - Allocate 64 GB disk (minimum).
   - Enable "Install drivers and SPICE tools".
4. Attach the Windows 11 ARM ISO and boot the VM.
5. Complete the Windows 11 installation (skip network during OOBE if needed; use a local
   account).

### Option B: VirtualBox / Hyper-V (x86)

- **VirtualBox:** download from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/), create a Windows
  11 x64 VM with at least 4 GB RAM, enable EFI and TPM 2.0 emulation.
- **Hyper-V:** available on Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise, enable via "Turn Windows features on
  or off".

### Network configuration

The Windows VM must be able to reach the DittoFS host on ports **12445** (SMB) and **12049**
(NFS).

| Network mode | When to use | Configuration |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Bridged** | VM and host on same LAN | VM gets its own IP from DHCP; use host's LAN IP to connect |
| **Host-only** | Isolated testing | Configure a host-only network adapter; use host-only gateway IP |
| **Shared (NAT)** | Default in UTM | Forward ports 12445 (SMB) and 12049 (NFS) from host to guest |

Verify connectivity from the Windows VM:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <host-ip> -Port 12445
```

### Required Windows features

**Client for NFS** (for NFS client testing):

1. Open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Optional Features** > **More Windows features**.
2. Expand **Services for NFS**, check **Client for NFS**, click OK and restart if prompted.

**SMB client:** installed and enabled by default on Windows 11; no additional setup needed.

### Guest auth GPO configuration

Windows 11 24H2 blocks insecure guest logons by default. For testing DittoFS with
guest/anonymous sessions:

**Option 1 — Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`):**

1. Press `Win+R`, type `gpedit.msc`, press Enter.
2. Navigate to: **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Network** >
   **Lanman Workstation**.
3. Double-click **"Enable insecure guest logons"**, set to **Enabled**, click OK.
4. Restart the Lanman Workstation service or reboot.

**Option 2 — Registry (Windows 11 Home or scripted):**

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Set-ItemProperty `
  -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" `
  -Name "AllowInsecureGuestAuth" -Value 1 -Type DWord
Restart-Service LanmanWorkstation
```

Registry path: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\AllowInsecureGuestAuth` = 1 (DWORD)

### DittoFS server setup for testing

On the macOS/Linux host:

```bash
# 1. Build DittoFS
go build -o dfs cmd/dfs/main.go
go build -o dfsctl cmd/dfsctl/main.go

# 2. Initialize config (first time only)
./dfs init

# 3. Start DittoFS
./dfs start

# 4. Create test stores
./dfsctl store metadata add --name test-meta --type memory
./dfsctl store block local add --name test-blocks --type memory

# 5. Create a test share
./dfsctl share create --name /smbbasic --metadata test-meta --local test-blocks

# 6. Create a test user
./dfsctl user create --username testuser    # enter password when prompted

# 7. Grant permissions
./dfsctl share permission grant /smbbasic --user testuser --level read-write

# 8. Verify the SMB adapter is listening on port 12445
./dfsctl adapter list
```

Connect from the Windows VM:

```cmd
rem Mapped drive
net use Z: \\<host-ip>\smbbasic /user:testuser <password>

rem UNC path
explorer \\<host-ip>\smbbasic
```

Optional software useful for testing:

| Software | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| VS Code | Test opening projects from SMB share, file editing, integrated terminal |
| Microsoft Office | Test Word/Excel save/open cycles with file locking |
| 7-Zip or WinRAR | Test archive extraction to/from share |

---

## Real NFSv3 NLM lock testing (network-namespace isolation)

DittoFS coordinates byte-range locks across NFSv3 NLM, NFSv4, and SMB through a single
cross-protocol lock manager (`pkg/metadata/lock/manager.go`). Proving this end-to-end with a
**real kernel NFSv3 client** — not the `nolock` mount option, which makes the kernel resolve
locks locally and never contact the server — requires a specific harness. This section explains
why, and how the e2e suite does it.

### Why a single host is not enough

A kernel NFSv3 client discovers the server's NLM (lockd) port by querying rpcbind on port 111 —
a location fixed by RFC 1833 with no client-side override. But the kernel's *own* lockd also
registers program 100021 with the local rpcbind. The moment an NFSv3-with-locking mount activates
on the same host as DittoFS, the kernel lockd reclaims the 100021 mapping, so the client sends its
NLM requests to the local kernel lockd instead of to DittoFS. You cannot run both a userspace NLM
server and a kernel NFSv3 client's lockd against one shared rpcbind.

This is the same constraint NFS-Ganesha hits, and DittoFS copies Ganesha's solution:
**isolate the client in a separate Linux network namespace.**

### Harness layout

```
  server netns (sns)                client netns (cns)
  ┌────────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────────┐
  │ dfs (NFSv3/v4 + SMB)    │        │ kernel NFSv3 client     │
  │ rpcbind :111 (own)      │◀──────▶│ rpcbind :111 (own)      │
  │   NLM 100021 → dfs port │  veth  │ rpc.statd (NSM)         │
  │                         │        │ mount -o nfsvers=3      │
  └────────────────────────┘        │   (NO nolock)           │
                                     └────────────────────────┘
```

Both the server and the client run in their *own* network namespace, each with its *own* rpcbind
and its own lockd/NSM port space, so the two 100021 registrations never collide. The server's
rpcbind is made private by launching dfs under `unshare --mount` with a fresh tmpfs on `/run` —
otherwise it would share the host's rpcbind socket. The client's `GETPORT` for NLM queries the
**server** namespace's rpcbind across the veth and correctly resolves to the DittoFS port;
SM_NOTIFY / GRANTED callbacks flow back over the same veth.

Gotchas mirrored from Ganesha (each is a real failure mode):

- **`rpc.statd` must run in the client netns.** Without a reachable NSM, the first lock fails with
  `SM_MON status 1` → `NLM4_DENIED_NOLOCKS`. The harness gates on a warm-up lock so a not-ready NSM
  can never be mistaken for a conflict.
- **Give each side its own rpcbind** (the netns-native form of Ganesha's multi-homed `rpcbind -h`
  fix). If you see "failed to contact remote rpcbind", a shared/misbound rpcbind is the usual cause.
- **Use IP addresses, not hostnames**, for the mount target and NSM — the two namespaces do not
  share DNS resolution.
- DittoFS must be started with system-rpcbind registration and UDP enabled (below); UDP carries
  NSM/SM_NOTIFY.

### Enabling server-side registration

The registration is opt-in (default off). The e2e harness turns it on at runtime:

```
PATCH /api/v1/adapters/nfs/settings
{ "portmapper_register_with_system": true, "udp_enabled": true }
```

Equivalent YAML / env: `adapters.nfs.portmapper.register_with_system: true` /
`DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_PORTMAPPER_REGISTER_WITH_SYSTEM=true`. See issue #1503.

### What it covers

- **NLM ↔ SMB** — an NFSv3 NLM byte-range lock conflicts with a CIFS byte-range lock on the same
  file, resolved by the server's unified lock manager (both directions).
- **NLM ↔ NFSv4** — an NFSv3 NLM lock conflicts with an NFSv4 `LOCK`, both directions.
- Registration reachability — `rpcinfo -p` shows DittoFS's NLM (100021) mapping.

### Running / prerequisites

These tests need **root**, `rpcbind`, `rpc.statd`, and `iproute2` (network namespaces), so they
run only on Linux. On unsupported environments (macOS, no root, no rpcbind) they `t.Skip` rather
than fail. In CI the e2e workflow installs `rpcbind` and the job runs privileged enough to create
namespaces; locally:

```bash
cd test/e2e
sudo ./run-e2e.sh --test TestNLMAxisInterop
```

Framework code lives in `test/e2e/framework/netns.go`; the tests in
`test/e2e/nlm_axis_interop_test.go`. The single-host reachability check (which cannot take a real
lock, for the reason above) is `TestNLMSystemRpcbindRegistration` in `test/e2e/nlm_locking_test.go`.

## Conformance test suites

DittoFS is validated against industry-standard conformance suites for SMB and
NFS. Every one of them runs through `test/conformance/run.sh` and is described
in `test/conformance/suites.json`:

<!-- conformance-suites:begin -->
<!-- Generated from test/conformance/suites.json by test/conformance/check-docs.sh. Do not edit by hand. -->

  [`../../test/smb-conformance/KNOWN_FAILURES.md`](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/test/smb-conformance/KNOWN_FAILURES.md)
- **Run locally:**
  ```bash
  cd test/smb-conformance
  make test        # Run WPTS BVT suite
  make test-quick  # Quick run (memory profile only)
  ```

### smbtorture (Samba Test Suite)

- **Suite:** Full SMB2 test suite (`smb2.*`)
- **Image:** `quay.io/samba.org/samba-toolbox:v0.8`
- **Known failures:** see
  [`../../test/smb-conformance/smbtorture/KNOWN_FAILURES.md`](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/test/smb-conformance/smbtorture/KNOWN_FAILURES.md)

  ```

### Running both SMB suites

```bash
cd test/smb-conformance
make test smbtorture     # Run WPTS + smbtorture in sequence
```

Both SMB suites run in CI via `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` on every PR touching
SMB-related code.

### pynfs (NFSv4 protocol)

The reference NFSv4 suite, and the only one that exercises the protocol rather than
filesystem semantics: state, sessions, owners, locking and wire error codes. It is its own
NFSv4 client, so it needs no kernel mount and no root — `test/posix/` and `test/e2e/` go
through a kernel client, which only ever sends the subset of the protocol it needs.

- **Suite:** pynfs NFSv4.0 (689 tests) and NFSv4.1 (269 tests)
- **Known failures:** see
  [`../../test/nfs-conformance/pynfs/KNOWN_FAILURES_V40.md`](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/test/nfs-conformance/pynfs/KNOWN_FAILURES_V40.md)
  and [`KNOWN_FAILURES_V41.md`](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/test/nfs-conformance/pynfs/KNOWN_FAILURES_V41.md)
- **Baseline:** [`baseline-knfsd.md`](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/blob/develop/test/nfs-conformance/pynfs/baseline-knfsd.md) —
  the same suite against the Linux kernel server, which is what distinguishes an assertion
  no server satisfies from one DittoFS fails alone
- **Run locally:**

## Device-loss crash testing (dm-flakey)

`test/crash/device-loss.sh` answers one question: can an acknowledged write come back
as the right size with zero content? Losing an uncommitted write in a crash is expected;
returning plausible-looking zeros for it is not, because no reader can tell the difference.

**`kill -9` does not test this.** The page cache outlives process death, so the data is
still there when the server restarts. Only device-level loss exposes the asymmetry between
metadata that reached stable storage and data that did not.

The rig puts the metadata store and the local block store on an ext4 filesystem over
`dm-flakey`, writes self-identifying 4096-byte records over SMB (`cache=none`, so every
`write()` is answered by the server), then swaps the device table to `drop_writes` with
`dmsetup suspend --noflush --nolockfs` — from that instant only bytes that genuinely
reached the device survive. The writer is stopped before the swap, so every record in its
ack log was answered while the device was healthy, and the ack log itself is fsynced to a
different disk. After the swap the server is killed, the device is restored to what
survived, and the file is read back.

```bash
sudo ./test/crash/device-loss.sh ./dfs ./dfsctl [write-seconds] [commit-every]
```

`commit-every` is how often the writer calls `fsync` (0 = never). The two modes test
opposite directions:

- **`0`** — nothing is ever committed, so nothing may be published. The file must come
  back short (or empty), never full-size-and-zeroed.
- **`64`** (default) — a durable prefix exists. Every fsynced record must read back
  byte-exact; only records written since the last fsync may be missing.

The verdict fails on any record that reads as zeros or garbage inside the file's own
size, and on any fsynced record that is missing.

Requires root, Linux with `dm-flakey`, `cifs-utils`, and `python3` — a VM, not a laptop.
