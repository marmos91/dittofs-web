## Protocol Overview

**NFS (Network File System)** is a distributed file system protocol that lets a client access files over a network as if they were on local storage. NFS uses **ONC RPC** for message framing and **XDR** for binary encoding. Each operation carries authentication credentials (UID/GID or Kerberos ticket) and a file handle — an opaque identifier for the file or directory being operated on.

The request/response flow:

```
Client                                Server
  |  1. TCP Connection (port 12049)     |
  | ----------------------------------> |
  |  2. MOUNT /export                   |
  | ----------------------------------> |
  |  <---- Root file handle ----------- |
  |  3. LOOKUP "file.txt"               |
  | ----------------------------------> |
  |  <---- File handle + attributes --- |
  |  4. READ (offset=0, count=4096)     |
  | ----------------------------------> |
  |  <---- Data + EOF flag ------------ |
  |  5. UMOUNT /export                  |
  | ----------------------------------> |
```

## Supported Versions

DittoFS implements **NFSv3**, **NFSv4.0**, **NFSv4.1**, and **NFSv4.2**.

| Version | Key Features |
|---------|--------------|
| NFSv3 | Stateless, 64-bit file sizes, TCP, async writes, WCC |
| NFSv4.0 | Stateful, ACLs, compound operations, RPCSEC_GSS (Kerberos) |
| NFSv4.1 | Sessions, backchannel, directory delegations with CB_NOTIFY |
| NFSv4.2 | Sparse files (ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, SEEK, READ_PLUS), server-side CLONE/reflink (RFC 7862) + extended attributes (RFC 8276) |

All versions listen on port **12049** by default (not the standard 2049). The embedded portmapper listens on **10111** by default.

CLONE (reflink), ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, SEEK, and READ_PLUS are implemented for NFSv4.2; inter-server COPY (OP_COPY) is not.

---

## Embedded Portmapper

DittoFS includes an embedded portmapper that enables standard NFS service discovery without requiring a system-level `rpcbind` daemon. It answers both legacy **PMAP v2** (RFC 1057, used by `rpcinfo -p` and Linux) and **RPCBIND v3/v4** (RFC 1833 universal addresses, used by macOS/BSD lock clients).

### Why an Embedded Portmapper?

NFS clients traditionally rely on a portmapper (port 111) to discover which port an NFS server is listening on. Without a portmapper, clients require explicit port options (`-o port=12049,mountport=12049`), and standard tools like `rpcinfo` and `showmount` do not work.

The embedded portmapper solves this by:

- Registering all DittoFS services (NFS, MOUNT, NLM, NSM) automatically on startup
- Responding to standard portmap queries via TCP and UDP
- Running on an unprivileged port (default 10111) to avoid requiring root
- Enabling `rpcinfo` and `showmount` to discover DittoFS services

### Service Discovery

With the portmapper running, standard NFS tools work:

```bash
# Query registered services
rpcinfo -p localhost -n 10111

# Show available exports
showmount -e localhost
```

### Configuration

The portmapper is disabled by default. Enable it via `dfsctl`:

```bash
# Check current settings
dfsctl adapter settings nfs

# Change the portmapper port
dfsctl adapter settings nfs update --portmapper-port 10111

# Disable the portmapper entirely
dfsctl adapter settings nfs update --portmapper-enabled=false
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_PORTMAPPER_PORT=10111
DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_PORTMAPPER_ENABLED=false
```

### Security

The embedded portmapper follows standard security practices:

- **SET/UNSET restricted to localhost**: Only local clients can register or unregister services
- **CALLIT (procedure 5) omitted**: Prevents DDoS amplification attacks
- **Connection limits**: TCP connections are capped at 64 concurrent
- **Non-privileged port**: Default port 10111 avoids requiring root privileges

### Portmapper Failure is Non-Fatal

If the portmapper fails to start (e.g., port already in use), NFS continues to operate normally. Clients just need to specify ports explicitly in mount options.

---

## NFSv3 File Locking (NLM/NSM)

NFSv3 has no in-protocol locking; byte-range locks travel over the separate
**NLM** (Network Lock Manager) protocol, with crash recovery coordinated by
**NSM** (Network Status Monitor). NFSv4 does not use NLM — its locking is
in-protocol, so none of this section applies to `vers=4` mounts.

> NFSv3 **mount and read/write need none of this.** Only byte-range locking
> (`flock`/`fcntl`/`lockf`) uses NLM. If you don't need cross-client locks,
> mount `-o nolock`, or use `-o vers=4` for in-protocol locking.

### What DittoFS serves

- **NLM** (program 100021) versions **1 and 3** (32-bit offsets) and **4**
  (64-bit offsets), including the **asynchronous `*_MSG`/`*_RES` procedures**
  (TEST/LOCK/CANCEL/UNLOCK_MSG → `*_RES` callbacks) that macOS/BSD `lockd` use,
  alongside the synchronous procedures Linux uses.
- **NSM** (program 100024) version 1, for crash-recovery monitoring (SM_MON /
  SM_NOTIFY). The SM_NOTIFY callback target is the request's transport source,
  not the client-supplied `my_name`.
- **Portmapper** speaking both legacy **PMAP v2** (RFC 1057) and **RPCBIND
  v3/v4** (RFC 1833, universal addresses) — macOS/BSD `lockd` discover NLM via
  RPCBIND v3/v4 and do not fall back to v2.
- All of the above over **TCP and UDP**. NFS data (program 100003) is
  **TCP-only** — it is never served over UDP (READ/WRITE payloads exceed a UDP
  datagram).

> **Status:** the full protocol chain (RPCBIND v3/v4 discovery → NSM monitoring
> → async NLM locking with reserved-port `*_RES` callbacks) is implemented and
> unit-tested. End-to-end acceptance against a live macOS client is validated on
> a same-LAN topology (a same-host loopback test is unreliable: the client and
> server contend for port 111 and a shared `lockd`/`statd`).

### Why macOS NFSv3 locking needs extra setup

A macOS/BSD lock client (`rpc.lockd` / `rpc.statd`) reaches NLM/NSM over **UDP**
and discovers them by querying the **server's portmapper on port 111** — there is
no mount option to redirect that lookup. So two server-side pieces, both
**disabled by default**, are required:

1. **UDP transport** — serve NLM/NSM/MOUNT over UDP:
   ```bash
   dfsctl adapter settings nfs update --udp-enabled true
   ```
2. **Portmapper on port 111** — so the client's discovery query resolves:
   ```bash
   dfsctl adapter settings nfs update --portmapper-enabled true --portmapper-port 111
   ```
   Binding 111 needs root or `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, and may clash with a host
   `rpcbind`. On Kubernetes the operator exposes port 111 via the adapter Service
   (mapped to the unprivileged container port), so no privileged binding is needed
   in the pod.

Restart the adapter after changing these settings. Linux clients (NLM v4) work
once the portmapper is reachable; they do not strictly require UDP, but enabling
it is harmless.

Equivalent config-file / env settings:

```yaml
adapters:
  nfs:
    udp:
      enabled: true
    portmapper:
      enabled: true
      port: 111
```

```bash
DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_UDP_ENABLED=true
DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_PORTMAPPER_ENABLED=true
DITTOFS_ADAPTERS_NFS_PORTMAPPER_PORT=111
```

### Recommended: just use NFSv4

For locking without any of the above, mount with `vers=4` — locking is part of
the protocol, and there is no NLM, NSM, MOUNT, or portmapper to configure:

```bash
dfsctl share mount /my-share /mnt/point --protocol nfs --nfs-version 4.1
# or directly:
mount -t nfs -o vers=4.1,port=12049 server:/my-share /mnt/point
```

---

## Mounting

### With Portmapper on Port 111

When the portmapper runs on the standard port 111 (requires root or `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`), NFS clients can auto-discover ports and mount commands are simplified:

```bash
# Configure portmapper on standard port (requires root)
dfsctl adapter settings nfs update --portmapper-port 111

# Linux - no port options needed, client queries portmapper automatically
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs
sudo mount -t nfs -o tcp localhost:/export /mnt/nfs

# macOS
mkdir -p /tmp/nfs
mount -t nfs -o tcp localhost:/export /tmp/nfs
```

### With Explicit Ports

When the portmapper is disabled or running on a non-standard port, specify the NFS port explicitly:

```bash
# Linux
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs
sudo mount -t nfs -o tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049 localhost:/export /mnt/nfs

# macOS (sudo not required)
mkdir -p /tmp/nfs
mount -t nfs -o tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049 localhost:/export /tmp/nfs

# macOS may require resvport on some configurations
mount -t nfs -o tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049,resvport localhost:/export /tmp/nfs

# Unmount
sudo umount /mnt/nfs   # Linux
umount /tmp/nfs        # macOS
```

---

## Kerberos Exports (sec=krb5)

NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1 can authenticate with Kerberos via RPCSEC_GSS. The server
verifies the client's Kerberos ticket against a keytab and maps the
authenticated principal to a DittoFS identity for permission checks.

**Mounting (Linux):**

```bash
# DittoFS listens on 12049, not the default 2049 — pass it explicitly.
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o vers=4.1,sec=krb5,port=12049 server:/export /mnt/dittofs
```

The non-default port also applies to the auth handshake; without `port=12049`
the client connects to 2049 and the mount fails with `Connection refused`
before Kerberos is ever attempted. (Run the embedded portmapper on 111 to drop
the explicit port — see [Embedded Portmapper](#embedded-portmapper).)

**Per-export policy.** Three NFS export options gate which auth flavors a share
accepts (set via `dfsctl adapter edit nfs` / the share's `NFSExportOptions`):

| Option | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `allow_auth_sys` | `true` | When `false`, AUTH_SYS (AUTH_UNIX) mounts/operations are refused. (Set `require_kerberos` to also refuse AUTH_NULL and mandate RPCSEC_GSS — `allow_auth_sys=false` alone only gates AUTH_SYS.) |
| `require_kerberos` | `false` | When `true`, every mount/operation must use RPCSEC_GSS; AUTH_SYS and AUTH_NULL are refused. |
| `min_kerberos_level` | `krb5` | Minimum GSS protection level a Kerberos session must negotiate (`krb5` = authentication, `krb5i` = + integrity, `krb5p` = + privacy). A session below the floor is refused. |

`allow_auth_sys`, `require_kerberos`, and `min_kerberos_level` are enforced
identically on **NFSv3** (at MOUNT) and on **NFSv4.0/v4.1** (at the first
operation that resolves the export handle — v4 has no MOUNT call). A refusal
surfaces as `NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC` (v4) / `MNT3ERR_ACCES` (v3), prompting the client
to retry with the correct flavor.

`min_kerberos_level` only constrains RPCSEC_GSS sessions: it rejects a Kerberos
session whose negotiated service level is below the floor (e.g. a plain `krb5`
authentication-only session on a `krb5p` privacy share). Non-GSS flavors are
governed by `allow_auth_sys` / `require_kerberos`; pair `min_kerberos_level`
with `require_kerberos=true` to mandate a protection floor for *all* access.

**Principal → identity mapping (the "access denied after EXCHANGE_ID" case).**
A successful `sec=krb5` mount has two stages, and they fail differently:

1. **GSS context establishment** (the client's `EXCHANGE_ID` / context init).
   This succeeds as soon as the ticket verifies against the server keytab.
2. **Authorization** of the mapped principal on the export. The authenticated
   principal is resolved to a DittoFS user (and UID/GID) through the identity
   store / idmap. A principal with **no mapping** resolves to **nobody**
   (UID 65534), and nobody is then subject to the export's
   `default_permission`: if that is `none`, the export denies the operation and
   the mount fails with `access denied` **even though the Kerberos handshake
   succeeded**.

This is by design — a host that mounts with its **machine** credential (no user
`kinit`, e.g. `nfs/host.realm@REALM` from `/etc/krb5.keytab`) authenticates as
the machine principal, which has no user identity. To grant such a mount:

- add an idmap entry (or a DittoFS user) for the principal so it resolves to a
  real UID/GID, **or**
- set the export's `default_permission` to `read` / `read-write` so unmapped
  (nobody) principals are admitted with that ceiling, **and** ensure the export
  root's POSIX mode permits the resulting identity to traverse it.

User principals (`alice@REALM`, obtained via `kinit`) that are present in the
idmap mount and access files as that user with no extra configuration.

## NFS-over-TLS (RFC 9289)

DittoFS can encrypt NFS wire traffic with TLS 1.3, using the opportunistic `AUTH_TLS` STARTTLS mechanism from RFC 9289. A client opens TCP and sends a `NULL` RPC with `auth_flavor = AUTH_TLS (7)`; the server replies with the 8-octet `"STARTTLS"` verifier, then both perform a TLS 1.3 handshake on the **same** connection. All subsequent RPC traffic is encrypted. Because Go performs the handshake and crypto in userspace, no kernel TLS (`kTLS`) or `tlshd` daemon is needed on the server.

DittoFS only loads cert files — issuance/renewal/rotation is the platform's job; rotated files are hot-reloaded with no restart (shared with the control-plane TLS path via `internal/tlsconfig`).

```yaml
adapters:
  nfs:
    tls:
      cert_file: /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.crt
      key_file:  /etc/dittofs/tls/tls.key
      client_ca: /etc/dittofs/tls/ca.crt   # optional → mutual TLS (client-cert auth)
      min_version: "1.3"                    # RFC 9289 floor is TLS 1.3
      mode: opportunistic                   # "opportunistic" (default) | "require"
```

- **`opportunistic`** (default): clients that send the `AUTH_TLS` probe are upgraded; clients that do not are still served in plaintext. Lets a TLS rollout proceed without breaking existing mounts.
- **`require`**: a connection must upgrade via `AUTH_TLS` before any other RPC; plaintext requests are rejected (connection dropped).

**Client interop:**

- **Linux:** `mount -o vers=4.1,xprtsec=tls …` — requires `tlshd` (ktls-utils) and `CONFIG_NET_HANDSHAKE` (RHEL 9.x / upstream kernel 6.7+).
- **macOS:** no NFS-over-TLS client — use Kerberos or a network-level tunnel instead.

## Testing Your Mount

```bash
# Start server
./dfs start -log-level DEBUG

# Mount (Linux)
sudo mount -t nfs -o tcp,port=12049,mountport=12049 localhost:/export /mnt/test
cd /mnt/test

# Exercise common operations
ls -la              # READDIR / READDIRPLUS
cat readme.txt      # READ
echo "test" > new   # CREATE + WRITE
mkdir foo           # MKDIR
rm new              # REMOVE
rmdir foo           # RMDIR
mv file1 file2      # RENAME
ln -s target link   # SYMLINK
ln file1 file2      # LINK (hard link)

# Run unit tests
go test ./...

# Run E2E tests (requires NFS client installed)
go test -v -timeout 30m ./test/e2e/...

# Run specific E2E suite
go test -v ./test/e2e -run TestE2E/memory/BasicOperations
```

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting](/docs/operations/troubleshooting) for common issues. Quick reference:

- **`Connection refused` on mount**: DittoFS listens on **12049**, not 2049. Always pass `-o port=12049,mountport=12049` unless the portmapper is running on 111.
- **`access denied` after Kerberos succeeds**: The principal has no idmap entry; it resolved to nobody and the export's `default_permission` is `none`. See [Kerberos Exports](#kerberos-exports-seckrb5) above.
- **`NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC`**: The client used AUTH_SYS on a Kerberos-only export (or vice versa). Check `allow_auth_sys` / `require_kerberos` on the share.
- **NFSv3 locks not working on macOS**: Requires UDP transport + portmapper on 111. See [NFSv3 File Locking](#nfsv3-file-locking-nlmnsm).
- **Configuration reference**: See [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) for the full `adapters.nfs` config block.
- **Security hardening**: See [Security](/docs/operations/security) for TLS, Kerberos, and export policy guidance.
