**DittoFS Pro** is the premium edition of DittoFS. It wraps the open-source
DittoFS server with a modern web dashboard, so administrators and users can
manage their entire deployment — stores, shares, adapters, users, and access
control — visually, without touching the CLI.

Everything `dfsctl` does today is available through the dashboard, plus
license management and white-label branding. It ships as a single Go binary
with the UI embedded — plus a Docker image — and runs fully air-gapped with an
offline license.

## How it relates to open-source DittoFS

DittoFS Pro builds **on top of** this open-source server — it imports DittoFS as
a Go module and talks to the same control-plane and auth endpoints. The core
filesystem, protocols, stores, and adapters documented in this repository are
identical; Pro adds the dashboard, licensing, and branding layer around them.

New control-plane APIs introduced for Pro are additive and remain backward
compatible with existing DittoFS deployments.

## Roadmap

DittoFS Pro is actively expanding toward enterprise deployments. Planned
additions include:

* **Monitoring dashboard** — live metrics, throughput, and health across stores,
  shares, and adapters.
* **Enterprise-grade features** — capabilities aimed at large, multi-tenant, and
  regulated environments.
* **Enterprise support** — SLAs and direct support for production deployments.
