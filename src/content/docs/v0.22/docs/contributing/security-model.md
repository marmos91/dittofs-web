## Threat model

DittoFS is a userspace network filesystem server. The threat model covers the following attack
surfaces:

**In scope:**

* **Network eavesdropping:** an attacker on the same network segment reading plaintext RPC or
  SMB traffic. Mitigations: SMB3 in-protocol AEAD encryption (`encryption_mode: required`),
  NFS-over-TLS (RFC 9289), Kerberos krb5p privacy (`sec=krb5p`), VPN/IPsec.
* **Credential spoofing (NFS):** a client sending arbitrary UID/GID values in AUTH\_UNIX.
  Mitigation: RPCSEC\_GSS (Kerberos) replaces trust-based UID with cryptographic identity;
  root squash limits privilege escalation when AUTH\_UNIX is unavoidable.
* **Session downgrade attacks (SMB):** a man-in-the-middle stripping security capabilities
  from the negotiate exchange. Mitigations: SMB 3.1.1 preauth integrity hash binds keys to the
  exact negotiate exchange; VALIDATE\_NEGOTIATE\_INFO on SMB 3.0/3.0.2; SMB signing rejection of
  tampered messages.
* **Message tampering:** an attacker modifying in-flight SMB or NFS messages.
  Mitigations: SMB signing (AES-CMAC/GMAC); AEAD authentication tag in SMB3 encryption;
  Kerberos GSS wrap tokens with checksum.
* **Control plane credential exposure:** admin credentials sent to the REST API in cleartext.
  Mitigation: loopback-only bind by default; native TLS when exposed to the network.
* **Keytab/machine-secret exfiltration:** unauthorized read of the keytab or machine account
  secret. Mitigation: filesystem permissions (`chmod 600`); API write-only redaction for
  machine secret.

**Out of scope (no current mitigation):**

* Encryption at rest (S3 server-side encryption can be enabled independently)
* Audit logging for file operations
* Denial-of-service attacks
* Side-channel attacks against cryptographic primitives

## RPCSEC\_GSS internals (NFS/Kerberos)

DittoFS implements RPCSEC\_GSS per RFC 2203 in `pkg/auth/kerberos` and the NFS protocol layer.
The shared Kerberos layer also serves the SMB SPNEGO path (see below).

**Security context establishment:**

1. Client sends a `NULL` procedure call with a `RPCSEC_GSS_INIT` credential containing a GSS
   token (Kerberos AP-REQ).
2. Server calls `gss_accept_sec_context` against the AP-REQ using the keytab. The keytab is
   hot-loaded and re-read on change — new contexts after a keytab rotation use the new key
   material immediately.
3. Server returns an `RPCSEC_GSS_INIT` reply with a GSS token (AP-REP) proving its identity to
   the client (mutual authentication). The context handle is stored per-connection.
4. Subsequent RPCs carry the context handle; the server maps the established principal to
   UID/GID and builds an `*metadata.AuthContext` for the operation.

**Security services:** DittoFS negotiates the GSS service requested by the client mount:

* `krb5` — authentication only; data is plaintext.
* `krb5i` — authentication + per-message integrity (GSS MIC token on each RPC).
* `krb5p` — authentication + per-message privacy (GSS wrap with encryption + integrity).

**Clock skew:** the maximum allowed difference between client and server clocks is configurable
(`max_clock_skew`, default `5m`). Kerberos tickets carry a validity window; requests outside the
window are rejected.

**Context TTL:** `context_ttl` (default `8h`) is the maximum lifetime of an RPCSEC\_GSS security
context. After expiry the client must re-authenticate.

***

## SPNEGO mechanics (SMB/Kerberos)

SMB Kerberos authentication follows the SPNEGO protocol (RFC 4178) during `SESSION_SETUP`.

**Negotiation flow:**

1. Server sends a `NEGOTIATE` response with a SPNEGO `NegTokenInit` advertising both the
   Kerberos OID (`1.2.840.113554.1.2.2`) and NTLM as supported mechanisms.
2. A client with a valid TGT obtains a service ticket for the `cifs/` SPN and sends an
   `AP-REQ` inside a SPNEGO `InitialContextToken`.
3. Server validates the `AP-REQ` against the shared keytab (same keytab as the NFS adapter).
4. Server sends an `AP-REP` (`NegTokenResp` with `accept-complete`) proving its identity to the
   client — **mutual authentication**. NTLM does not provide this property.
5. The session key from the Kerberos ticket is used as input to the SP800-108 KDF to derive
   SMB3 per-purpose keys (see [Key derivation](#key-derivation)).

**Principal mapping:** the SMB adapter automatically derives the `cifs/` SPN from the configured
`nfs/` service principal. The client Kerberos principal (without realm) is mapped to a DittoFS
control plane user for authorization.

**NTLM fallback:** when Kerberos is unavailable, the server falls back to NTLMv2. For local
DittoFS users, the NTLMv2 response is validated against the stored NT hash. For AD domain users,
the challenge/response is forwarded to the DC over a sealed NETLOGON secure channel (MS-NRPC
sign+seal AES, post-ZeroLogon); the DC-returned SID is resolved through the LDAP/idmap pipeline,
yielding the same UID/GID as Kerberos.

## SMB3 cipher and transform design

### Encryption

SMB3 provides encryption using AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) ciphers,
delivering both confidentiality and integrity for all messages on an encrypted session. The
encryption is in-protocol — not TLS or QUIC.

**Wire format:** each encrypted SMB message is wrapped in a `TRANSFORM_HEADER`:

```
Signature      [16]byte  — AEAD authentication tag
Nonce          [16]byte  — 128-bit or 96-bit, depending on cipher
OriginalMsgSz  uint32    — size of the plaintext
Reserved       uint16
Flags          uint16    — 0x0001 = encrypted
SessionID      uint64
```

The `Flags` + `SessionID` of the transform header are the AEAD additional data. This binds the
ciphertext to the session and prevents cross-session replay.

**Cipher selection:** for SMB 3.1.1, the cipher is negotiated via the
`SMB2_ENCRYPTION_CAPABILITIES` negotiate context. DittoFS prefers AES-128-GCM (fastest, hardware
accelerated) but accepts AES-256-GCM, AES-128-CCM, and AES-256-CCM in that order. For SMB
3.0/3.0.2, AES-128-CCM is mandatory.

**Encryption modes:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `disabled` | No encryption; startup WARN if not on loopback |
| `preferred` (default) | SMB 3.x sessions encrypted; SMB 2.x accepted |
| `required` | Only encrypted SMB 3.x clients accepted; SMB 2.x rejected at NEGOTIATE |

**Per-share enforcement:** `checkEncryptionRequired` rejects unencrypted requests on a share
configured with `encrypt_data`, returning `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`, regardless of the global mode.
`SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA` is set at `SESSION_SETUP` in `required` mode; in `preferred`
mode AEAD keys are derived but the flag is not set.

### Signing

SMB3 introduces AES-based signing algorithms:

| Algorithm | Dialect | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| HMAC-SHA256 | SMB 2.x | Uses session key directly; legacy |
| AES-128-CMAC | SMB 3.0+ | Uses SP800-108 derived `SigningKey` |
| AES-128-GMAC | SMB 3.1.1 | Preferred; leverages GCM hardware |

**Algorithm negotiation (3.1.1):** the `SMB2_SIGNING_CAPABILITIES` negotiate context lets client
and server agree on a signing algorithm. DittoFS prefers GMAC > CMAC. Clients omitting the
signing capability context default to AES-128-CMAC.

**Signed-when-encrypted:** after `SESSION_SETUP` completes (non-guest sessions), all messages
are signed. Signing is redundant when AEAD encryption is active, but DittoFS signs encrypted
messages to match Windows Server behavior and maintain broad client compatibility.

### Preauth integrity (downgrade protection)

SMB 3.1.1 maintains a running SHA-512 hash (the "preauth integrity hash") over the raw bytes of
every `NEGOTIATE` and `SESSION_SETUP` message:

```
PreauthHash = SHA-512(PreauthHash || message_bytes)
```

This hash is used as the **KDF context** when deriving per-session keys. Any MITM modification
of negotiate messages (e.g., stripping encryption or signing capabilities) produces a different
hash, which produces different derived keys, causing `SESSION_SETUP` to fail with a MAC mismatch.

For SMB 3.0/3.0.2 (which predate preauth integrity), `FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO` provides
downgrade detection: the client sends its original negotiate parameters, and if the server's
stored state differs, the connection is dropped.

### Key derivation

SMB3 derives per-purpose keys from the session key using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode KDF with
HMAC-SHA256 (`pkg/smb/crypto`):

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `SigningKey` | AES-CMAC/GMAC message signing |
| `EncryptionKey` | Server-to-client AES-GCM/CCM encryption |
| `DecryptionKey` | Client-to-server AES-GCM/CCM decryption |
| `ApplicationKey` | Application-level cryptographic operations |

**Dialect-specific label/context strings:**

* **SMB 3.0/3.0.2:** fixed label strings (e.g., `"SmbSign\0"`, `"ServerIn \0"`).
* **SMB 3.1.1:** the preauth integrity hash is used as the KDF context, binding all four derived
  keys to the exact negotiate/session-setup exchange.

The session key itself is the Kerberos ticket session key (when using Kerberos/SPNEGO), or the
NTLMv2 session key (when falling back to NTLM).

### Guest sessions and NTLM fallback

**Guest sessions:** no session key is available, so no signing and no encryption are possible.
`SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST` is set. In `required` encryption mode, a guest session is rejected
rather than accepted unencrypted. Guest sessions should be restricted to read-only public shares.

**NTLM session key weakness:** the NTLMv2 session key is derived from the NT password hash,
which is weaker than a Kerberos session key. Signing uses HMAC-SHA256 rather than AES-CMAC/GMAC.
NTLM does not provide mutual authentication, making the client unable to verify server identity
and leaving the connection vulnerable to relay attacks without SMB channel binding.

## Transport security comparison

| Property | SMB3 encryption | NFS Kerberos (krb5p) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Confidentiality | AES-128-GCM / AES-128-CCM | AES-256 wrap (RFC 3962) |
| Integrity | AEAD tag (built into cipher) | Kerberos checksum |
| Key derivation | SP800-108 from session key | Kerberos sub-session key |
| Per-message overhead | 52 bytes (transform header) | ~28 bytes (GSS wrap token) |
| Downgrade protection | Preauth integrity hash (3.1.1) | GSS-API mechanism negotiation |
| Mutual auth | Via Kerberos AP-REP | Built into RPCSEC\_GSS |
| Hardware acceleration | AES-NI + CLMUL (GCM) | Depends on krb5 library |

Both protocols provide strong transport security when properly configured. SMB3 encryption is
built into the protocol (no external infrastructure required beyond the DittoFS config). NFS
krb5p requires a functioning Kerberos infrastructure but provides the same security properties.
